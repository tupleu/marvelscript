Melina: Right, you?
Natasha: Yeah.
Melina: Yeah?
Yelena: Look! Forest stars.
Melina: Yeah. You know what? Those are actually part of the Lampyridae family. And the glow, the glow that you see, that comes from a chemical reaction called… bioluminescence. Come on, time for dinner.
Yelena: Bio-goomin-feasants?
Melina: “Bio-goomin-feasants.” That’s right. Dinner! Come on, dinner, big girl!
Yelena: I want mac and cheese.
Melina: Oh, you want mac and cheese? Okay. Well, I want… caviar and champagne. Grab the napkins. You take this. Thank you. Oh, would you grab the ranch dressing for Dad?

Yelena: If you’re so sure, then tell me what happened. Tell me exactly.
Natasha: We rigged bombs.
Yelena: Who’s “we”?
Natasha: Clint Barton. Killing Dreykov was the final step in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Yelena: Simple as that?
Natasha: Yeah, sure, “simple.” That’s what I’d call imploding a five-story building and then shooting it out with the Hungarian Special Forces. Took 10 days in hiding before we could even get out of Budapest.

Natasha: Wait, what are the big ones?
Yelena: Well, I doubt the god from space has to take an ibuprofen after a fight. Where did you think I was all this time?
Natasha: I thought that you got out and were living a normal life.
Yelena: And you just never made contact again?
Natasha: Honestly, I thought you didn’t wanna see me.
Yelena: (SCOFFS) Bullshit. You just didn’t want your baby sister to tag along, whilst you saved the world with the cool kids.
Natasha: You weren’t really my sister.
Yelena: And the Avengers aren’t really your family. Why do you always do that thing?
Natasha: Do what?
Yelena: The thing you do when you’re fighting. The… Like, the… This thing that you do when you whip your hair when you’re fighting with the arm and the hair. And you do, like, a fighting pose. (LAUGHS) It’s a… (LAUGHS) It’s a fighting pose. You’re a total poser.
Natasha: I’m not a poser.
Yelena: (LAUGHS) Oh, come on. I mean, they’re great poses, but it does look like you think everyone’s looking at you, like, all the time.
Natasha: All that time that I spent posing, I was trying to actually do something good to make up for all the pain and suffering that we caused. Trying to be more than just a trained killer.
Yelena: Well, then you were fooling yourself because pain and suffering is every day and we are both still a trained killer. Except I’m not the one that’s on the cover of a magazine. I’m not the killer that little girls call their hero.

Natasha: Is that all there is left?
Yelena: Mmm-hmm. It’s the only thing that can stop Dreykov and his network of widows.

Yelena: He takes more every day. Children who don’t have anyone to protect them. Just like us when we were small. Maybe one in 20 survives the training, becomes a widow. The rest, he kills. To him, we are just things. Weapons with no face that he can just throw away. Because there is always more. And no one’s even looking for him, thanks to you and Alexei.

Yelena: (CHUCKLES) You’re going to give me some big hero speech, I can feel it.

Yelena: I knew it. I knew you did. It’s so cool, right?
Natasha: It’s good. Yes. I like it.

Alexei: Ah… (CHUCKLING)
Alexei: Wow.
(EXCLAIMS IN RUSSIAN)
Alexei: (GROANS) Okay.
Alexei: Why the aggression, huh?
Alexei: Is it your time of the month?
Yelena: I don’t get my period, dipshit. I don’t have a uterus.
Natasha: Or ovaries.
Yelena: Yeah. That’s what happens when the Red Room gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.
Yelena: They kind of just go in and they rip out all of your reproductive organs.
Yelena: They just get right in there and they chop them all away.
Yelena: Everything out, so you can’t have babies.
Alexei: Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!
Alexei: You don’t have to get so clinical and nasty.
Yelena: Oh, well, I was about to talk about fallopian tubes, but okay.
Alexei: No.
Alexei: It means so much to me that you came back for me.
Natasha: No. No. You’re gonna tell us how to get to the Red Room.
Alexei: Huh.
Alexei: Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.
Natasha: Trust me, this isn’t pleasure.
Alexei: Little Natasha, all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.
Natasha: I chose to go west to become an Avenger.
Natasha: ‘Cause they treated me like family.
Alexei: Really? Family?
Alexei: Well, where are they now?
Alexei: Where is that family now?
Natasha: Tell me where the Red Room is.
Alexei: I have no idea.
(SCOFFS)
Alexei: Okay?
(HEADSET CLATTERS)
Natasha: Come on. You and Dreykov were like…
Alexei: Dreykov?
Natasha: Yeah.
Alexei: General Dreykov, my friend, huh?
Alexei: Gives me glory…
Alexei: Soviet Union’s first and only super soldier. I could have been more famous than Captain America. Then he buries me in Ohio on that stupid mission. Three years! So tedious, boring me to tears. No offense, huh? Then puts me in prison for the rest of my life. Why, huh? Why? Why would he put me in… You know why? ‘Cause maybe I want to talk about the withering of the state. Or maybe I don’t like his hair or something and I say something casually about that. Maybe, you know, I want the Party to feel actually like a party instead of this sourpuss organization. But instead, no. He puts me in prison for the rest of my life. He just runs off and hides, huh? I’m not even the one who, uh, you know… I’m not the one who killed his daughter.
Yelena: (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) Great! 
Yelena: (IN ENGLISH) Can we throw him out the window now?
Natasha: I think we should wait till we get to a higher altitude.
Yelena: All right.
Alexei: (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Why not ask Melina where it is?
Yelena: (IN ENGLISH) Wait, Mom Melina?
Natasha: We thought she was dead.
(Alexei SCOFFS)
Alexei: You cannot kill a fox that swift.
Natasha: Ew.
Alexei: What?
Alexei: She was the scientist, the strategist. I was the muscle. She worked directly for Dreykov far more than I ever did.
Natasha: Wait. Are you telling me that Melina is working for the Red Room present day?
Alexei: She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.
Yelena: (SCOFFS) Uh…
Yelena: I don’t think we have enough fuel for St. Petersburg.
Alexei: No, we’re good. We’ll make it.
Yelena: Okay.
(POWERING DOWN)
(SIGHS)
Alexei: You should’ve brought the Avengers’ superjet.
Yelena: I swear, if I hear one more word from him, I will kick him in the face.
Natasha: (SOFTLY) He’s the worst.
Alexei: Natasha. Natasha. Natasha. Come here, I want to ask you something. Come, it’s important.
Natasha: What?
Alexei: Did he talk to you about me?
Natasha: What?
Alexei: Did he talk to you about me? You know, trading war stories?
Natasha: Who? What are you talking about?
Alexei: Captain America. My great adversary in this theater of geopolitical conflict. Not so much a nemesis. More like a contemporary, you know? Coequal. I always thought there was a great deal of mutual respect…
Natasha: Wait. You haven’t seen either one of us in 20 years and you’re gonna ask me about you?
Alexei: What is with this tension? Did I do something wrong?
Yelena: Is that a serious question?
Alexei: I only ever loved you girls. I did my best to make sure you would succeed to achieve your fullest potential, and everything worked out.
Natasha: Everything worked out?
Alexei: Yes. For you, yes. We accomplished our mission in Ohio. Yelena, you went on to become the greatest child assassin the world has ever known. No one can match your efficiency, your ruthlessness. And Natasha, not just a spy, not just toppling regimes, destroying empires from within, but an Avenger. You both have killed so many people. Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red. I couldn’t be more proud of you.
(Natasha SCOFFS)
Yelena: Okay. You can… No. Let go of me now. You smell really bad.
Yelena: So, are we there yet?
Alexei: You’ll know when we’re there.

Melina: Welcome to my humble abode. Make yourself at home. Let’s have a drink. (SIGHS)
Natasha: Hey, no funny business.
Melina: I am putting away my weapon.
(SIGHS)
Natasha: Are there any booby traps around here? Anything we need to know about?
Melina: I didn’t raise my girls to fall in traps.
Natasha: You didn’t raise us at all.
Melina: Oh, maybe so. But if you got soft, it wasn’t on my watch.

Yelena: Oh, my God.
(LAUGHING)
Melina: I never washed it once. Come and drink. 
Alexei: (SINGING) Rise, you workers of salvation. (SCATTING) Family back together again. Mmm.
Melina: Seeing as our family construct was just a calculated ruse that only lasted three years, I don’t think that we can use this term anymore, can we?
Natasha: Agreed. So, here’s what’s gonna happen…
Alexei: Okay. A reunion then, huh? And, uh… I want to say something right off the bat. You haven’t aged a day, huh? You’re just as beautiful and as supple as the day they staged our marriage.
Melina: You got fat. But still good.
Alexei: (Alexei CHUCKLES) I just got out of prison. I, uh… I have a lot of energy.
Melina: Oh!
Natasha: Please don’t do that. So, here’s what’s gonna happen.
Melina: Natasha, don’t slouch.
Natasha: I’m not slouching.
Melina: Yes, yes, you are.
Natasha: I don’t slouch.
Melina: You’re going to get a back hunch.
Alexei: Listen to your mother.
Natasha: Oh, my God, this…
Alexei: Up, up.
Natasha: All right, enough. All of you.
Yelena: I didn’t say anything. That’s not fair.
Natasha: Here’s what’s gonna happen…
Yelena: I don’t want any food.
Melina: Eat a little something, Yelena, for God’s sake.
Natasha: You’re gonna tell us the location of the Red Room.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Melina: You know, it’s like when you told them that they could stay up late to catch Santa Claus.
Alexei: What? That was fun. You know, “He come down the chimney, girls. Look out. Where is he?” You wait for him, and then when the cookies are gone, then you see he’s there. No, no. What? I want them to follow their dreams.
Melina: No good.
Alexei: Reach for the stars, girls.
Natasha: Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy. It’s unfinished business.
Melina: You can’t defeat a man who commands the very will of others. You never saw the culmination of what we started in America. Nor did you.
Alexei: Natasha, always focus, focus. Get what you want.
(BEEPING)
Melina: Come in.
(DOOR OPENS)
(SNORTING)
Natasha: Did that pig just open the door?
Melina: Yes. It did. Good boy, Alexei. Good boy.
Alexei: You named a pig after me?
Melina: You don’t see the resemblance? See, he sits just like dog. Amazing. Now, watch.
Alexei: It’s a little weird, to me.
Melina: Stop breathing.
(PIG Alexei GRUNTS)
Melina: We infiltrated the North Institute in Ohio. It was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. Actually, it was Hydra scientists at that time. In conjunction with the Winter Soldier project, they had dissected and deconstructed the human brain to create the first and only cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia. Was the hub for cognition. Voluntary motor movement, procedural learning. We didn’t steal weaponry or technology. We stole the key to unlocking free will.
(PIG Alexei GROANS)
Natasha: What are you doing?
Melina: Oh, I am explaining that the science is now so exact, the subject can be instructed to stop breathing and has no choice but to obey.
Natasha: Okay, you made your point. That’s enough.
Melina: Yes, all right. Well, don’t worry, Alexei could’ve survived 11 more seconds without oxygen. Good boy. Now, you go back, back home where it’s safe.
(GRUNTS)
Melina: You go. You go back home, back home where it’s safe. Good boy, Alexei. The world functions on a higher level when it is controlled. Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents planted around the globe.
Yelena: And do you know who they test it on?
Melina: Hmm… No. That’s not my department.
Alexei: Ah, come on, come on. Don’t lie to them. Hmm?
Melina: I’m not lying.
Alexei: You’re Dreykov’s architect, huh?
Melina: What were you? If I was his architect, you were his partner. You were his business partner.
Alexei: No, no, no. I was patsy! (BANGS TABLE)
Melina: Don’t give me that…
Alexei: He sell me ideology.
Melina: Stop with the politics.
Alexei: All the while, bigger…
Natasha: Shut up! You are an idiot. And you’re a coward. You’re a coward. And our family was never real, so there’s nothing to hold on to. We’re moving on.
Alexei: Never family, huh? In my heart, I am simple man. And I think that for a couple deep undercover Russian agents I think we did pretty great as parents, huh? Yes, we had our orders, and we played our roles to perfection.
Natasha: Who cares? That wasn’t real.
Yelena: What?
Natasha: That wasn’t real. Who cares?
Yelena: Don’t say that. Please don’t say that. It was real. It was real to me. You are my mother. You were my real mother. The closest thing I ever had to one. The best part of my life was fake.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Yelena: And none of you told me.
(BANGS TABLE SOFTLY)
Yelena: And those agents you chemically subjugated around the globe? That was me. Mmm. And you, you got out. Dreykov made sure no one could escape. Are you gonna say anything? No. Don’t touch me.
Natasha: Yelena.
Yelena: No.
Melina: I had no idea.
Alexei: It’s okay, it’s okay. I’ll go talk to her.
Yelena: I came in here because I didn’t want to talk.
Alexei: Okay. We, uh… We just sit. We just sit.
Melina: Where are you going?
Natasha: To do this myself.
Melina: Don’t. You won’t survive.
Natasha: I wish I could believe that you cared. But you’re not even the first mother that abandoned me.
Melina: No, you weren’t abandoned. You were selected by a program that assessed the genetic potential in infants.
Natasha: I was taken?
Melina: I believe a bargain was struck, your family paid off. But your mother, she never stopped looking for you. She was like you in that way. She was relentless.
Natasha: What happened to her?
Melina: Dreykov had her killed. Her existence threatened to uncover the Red Room. Normally, the actions of one curious civilian wouldn’t warrant an execution, but, as I said, she was relentless.
Natasha: I thought about her every day of my life. Whether or not I admitted it to myself, I did.
Melina: I’ve always found it best not to look into the past.
Natasha: Then why did you save this? I remember this day. We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter and summer vacation all in one day. Different backdrops.
Melina: Mmm.
Natasha: I knew all the presents under the tree were just empty boxes, but I didn’t care. I wanted to open every single one… so just for a second it would feel real.
Melina: Let’s stop this.
Natasha: Why you doing this? 
Melina: Why does a mouse born in a cage run on that little wheel? Do you know I was cycled through the Red Room four times before you were even born? Those walls are all I know. I was never given a choice.
Natasha: But you’re not a mouse, Melina. You were just born in a cage, but that’s not your fault.
(Melina SCOFFS)
Melina: Tell me, how did you keep your heart?
Natasha: Pain only makes us stronger. Didn’t you tell us that? What you taught me kept me alive.
Melina: I’m sorry, I already alerted the Red Room. They’ll be here any minute.
Alexei: So, there I am ice fishing with my father. It’s very cold day in this little ice shed. Cold even for Russia, you know? “Keep the vodka by the fire,” my father would say to me.
Yelena: Please stop talking.
Alexei: Please wait. Please wait.
Yelena: Please, no. Please, I don’t want to talk.
Alexei: Please. Please. There is a reason why I’m telling you this, okay? Trust me. I am reaching for fish. Oh! I lose balance. Ah! Splash! My hands go in the river.
(SCOFFS)
Alexei: In this weather, frostbite sets in quick. My father, he go toilet on my hands.
Yelena: Oh, my God.
Alexei: Urine is 35 degrees Celsius, staves off the frostbite.
Yelena: How is this relevant?
Alexei: You know, fathers.
Yelena: No. No. You have done nothing but tell me how bored you were. I was the chore, the job you didn’t want to do. To me? To me, you were everything. Exactly. You don’t care. You don’t care. The only thing you care about are your stupid glory days as the Crimson Dynamo, and no one wants to hear about it.
Alexei: (WHISPERS) It’s the Red Guardian.
Yelena: Get out. Get out!
(SIGHS)
Alexei: (SINGING) I can’t remember if I cried. When I read about his widowed bride. Something touched me deep inside. The day. The music. Died. And they were singing

Alexei: Bye
Yelena: Bye
Alexei: Miss American Pie
Yelena: American Pie
Alexei: Drove my Chevy to the levee. But the levee was dry
Yelena: Was dry
Alexei: Them good old boys. Drinking whiskey. Singing
Alexei and Yelena BOTH: “This will be the day that I die”. “This’ll be the day…”

(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON RADIO)
Alexei: Melina?
Melina: (IN ENGLISH) We’re touching down in one minute.
Alexei: Then why are we still going up?
Melina: Now you’ll know how Dreykov stayed above the radar all these years.
(SYNCHRONIZED FOOTSTEPS)
(BUZZER SOUNDS)
Dreykov: My God. Look at you. (CHUCKLES) So, uh, how was the family reunion? Oh, it was awful. 
Natasha: They were clingy, and too emotional, and needy. 
Dreykov: (CHUCKLING) Just like old times, huh?
Natasha: Hmm.
Dreykov: Yelena Belova. What’s the deal with her? She was the only one affected, right? 
Natasha: As far as I know, yes. 
Dreykov: These gasses and antidotes, it’s a pain in my ass. It’s a problem. You need to sort it.
Natasha: Hmm. I have nine pigs that will require attending to in my absence.
Dreykov: Don’t give a shit about your pigs. Cut her brain out… Hmm? Identify the weakness.
(MONITORS BEEPING)
Yelena: This is a much less cool way to die.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(Alexei GRUNTING)
(THUMPING)
Melina: Alexei.
(Alexei PANTING)
Natasha: What about Romanoff?
Dreykov: She’s a traitor. She turned her back on her people. On her blood. She had nothing. I gave her home. I gave her love. Put that thing in her you do. You know, uh, chemicals. Turn her into one of your pigs. Can you imagine what I could do with an Avenger under my control?
Natasha: Wouldn’t you like to speak to her first?
Dreykov: When you look into the eyes of a child you have raised, no mask in the world can hide that.
(DEVICE WHIRS SOFTLY)
Dreykov: Welcome home. Now, now. Don’t go breaking my new toy.
Alexei: Natasha. I can’t save us. (ON SPEAKERS) I need you to know that I’m sorry. 
Melina: (SIGHS) 
Alexei: I pledged my life to a cause. You know, I thought I was being very brave. Possibly the bravest. But I wasn’t being brave. I was coward. (SOBBING) In Cuba, when they came and took you away from me… (SIGHS) No cause is worth that. You should only sacrifice yourself for something… (GLASS SQUEAKING) How did you do that?
Melina: I designed these cells myself.
Alexei: What? What? I bared my soul to you and it was just you the whole time?
Melina: Yes, I’m afraid so. But wait, shh, I’m on comms with Yelena. Yelena, it’s me. It’s Mama. You have a two-inch blade concealed in your beltline.
Yelena: What? What are you going to do to me?
Melina: Outside right hip.
(SCIENTIST SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

Yelena: You couldn’t have told me sooner?
Melina: Don’t throw a fit. There wasn’t time.
Alexei: Okay, girls, I’m having trouble hearing you, but, Natasha, there’s something I need you to know. I need you to know that I’m sorry. No more excuses, okay? I gave my life for a cause. I thought I was being brave.
Melina: You don’t have earpiece.
Alexei: What?
Melina: No, she can’t hear you. You don’t have earpiece.
Alexei: Why not?
Melina: Because it wasn’t part of the plan.
Alexei: Oh, yeah? Well, what was the plan?
Natasha: So, once we’re inside, I’ll activate my tracker and Ross will come running.
Melina: You are aware that you are still a global fugitive, yes?
Natasha: You know the facility. There must be some way to land it.
Melina: Instruct them to confine us on level zero. Once I’m out, I can activate the landing protocol, we can descend within the hour. Ah, problem. I only have one earpiece set.
Natasha: I’ll give it to Yelena.
Yelena: Where did he take the vials?
Melina: Probably down to cold storage. Dreykov still has the widows under his control, so you have to expose them to this antidote.
Yelena: Yeah. Sure. Easy.
Dreykov: Is this your plan?
Natasha: My plan is to kill you.
Dreykov: I’m alive. So, what do we do now?
Natasha: What was my mother’s name?
Dreykov: Ah… Where we buried her, there was a tree… Um… A pink blossom. Beautiful. And there was a tombstone with her name engraved on it. What was her name? Ah. (CHUCKLES) “Unknown.”
Natasha: You don’t feel anything? You feel anything when I killed your daughter?
Dreykov: I s this your haunted past? Really? (LAUGHING) Thank you, Natasha. You gave me my greatest weapon. Say hello. When your bomb exploded, it nearly killed my Antonia. I had to put a chip in the back of her neck. In the back of her neck. Look at her. You find it difficult to look at her? I do. She… She watches everything and she can do it. She’s a perfect mimic. And she fights just like all of your friends.
Natasha: Can she hear me?
Dreykov: What? You want to make her feel better? You want to tell her you’re sorry? Well, you should have thought of that before you blew her face off. But enough of all this bullshit. Go to work. I have rats in the basement. Go. Go.
Natasha: Well, that was a mistake.
Dreykov: Was it?
Natasha: You just sent away the one thing that would stop me from killing you.
Dreykov: Try, then. Do it.
(Natasha GRUNTING)
Dreykov: Is the safety on?
(STRAINING)
Dreykov: No. Try your knife.
(GRUNTING)
Dreykov: Ah…
(Natasha GASPS)
(KNIFE CLATTERS)
Dreykov: You’re in trouble.
Natasha: How are you controlling me?
Dreykov: I’m not controlling you, Natasha. Well, not yet. But there is a pheromonal lock. Smelling my pheromones prevents you from committing violence against me. I’m very upset with Melina. It’s a shame I have to kill her.
Alexei: Come on, now. If we’re just going to press buttons and hack computers…
Melina: Yes. Alexei: I mean, I don’t know.
Alexei: There’s nothing for me to do. I want to… I want to break something.
Melina: Oh, you do?
(GRUNTS)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Melina: Oh, there is something you can break.
(CHUCKLING)
(GRUNTS)
Alexei: Melina, if this is the last time that we… Ah, damn it.
Yelena: (SHUDDERS) That was disgusting.
(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
Yelena: Okay.
(STRAINING)
Dreykov: So, this was the big plan, huh? Melina was going to land the Red Room and hand me over to the authorities.
(ALARM BLARING)
Melina: Oh, no, no, no.
Natasha: So, what now, you’re gonna fold me into your pathetic little puppeteer act?
Dreykov: Pathetic, huh?
Natasha: Yeah, what would you call it?
Dreykov: I would call it…
Natasha: When was the last time that you had a conversation with somebody that wasn’t forced to talk to you?
Dreykov: You ran away to fight in the wrong war. The real war was fought here, in the shadows.
Natasha: You didn’t fight in the shadows. You hid in the dark.
Dreykov: Real power comes from undetectable influence.
Natasha: If no one’s noticed, then why even do it? You’re nothing.
Dreykov: Hmm.
Natasha: You have nothing.
Dreykov: There are 50 people on this planet…
Natasha: (SCOFFING) Oh, stop it.
Dreykov: (SHOUTING) Don’t tell me to stop!
Natasha: If I don’t tell you when to stop, then how will you know when to shut up?
(Natasha GRUNTS)
Natasha: Come on. Think I can’t take a punch? (CHUCKLES)
Dreykov: Oh.
(GRUNTS)
Natasha: God damn it, you’re weak.
Dreykov: Weak?
Natasha: I bet it’s easier to be tough in front of defenseless little girls, huh?
Dreykov: That’s enough.
(GRUNTS)
Dreykov: You wouldn’t be so glib if you had any notion of the scope of what I’ve built. I own this world. Me.
Natasha: You seem desperate to impress me.
Dreykov: I don’t need to impress you. I don’t need to impress anyone. These world leaders, these great men, they answer to me and my widows. Look at them. These girls were trash. They are thrown out into the street. I recycle the trash. And I give them purpose. I give them a life.
Yelena: Melina, I found the location of the vials.
Melina: I’ve had a slight setback. You’ll need to get to the widows.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Dreykov: It’s my network of widows that help me control the scales of power. One command, the oil and stock markets crumble. One command, and a quarter of the planet will starve. My widows can start and end wars. They can make and break kings.
Natasha: You control all of that from here?
Dreykov: And with you, an Avenger under my control, I can finally come out of the shadows using the only natural resource that the world has too much of. Girls.
Natasha: All from that little console?
Dreykov: Yeah. Oh, you find this amusing? Why are you smiling?
Natasha: Don’t take it personal, but, uh… Thank you for your cooperation.
Melina: Even if you locate the database and get him to show you the key, you won’t be able to take it from him. For years, Dreykov has implemented a pheromonal lock in all widows, even me. So, as long as we can smell him, then we won’t be able to hurt him.
Natasha: (SCOFFS) Well, I’ll just hold my breath.
Melina: Not enough. This is basic science. Natasha, to block receptors in olfactory center, you have to sever the nerve.
Natasha: I can handle that. 
Natasha: You weren’t quite strong enough, so… I’ll have to finish it myself.
Dreykov: (CHUCKLES) What are you going to do?
(GRUNTS)
Natasha: Sever the nerve.

Yelena: Fantastic. I’m heading to the widows now. No.

Natasha: Not so talkative now, are you? (GRUNTS) You took my childhood. You took my choices and tried to break me. But you’re never gonna do that to anybody ever again.

Natasha: Besides, if it can work out with the four of us, you know, there may be some hope for the Avengers. Little bit.
Yelena: Okay, well, if you’re leaving, then I guess you should take this. I know how much you like it.
Natasha: Shucks. (LAUGHS) It does have a lot of pockets.
Yelena: Very handy pockets, yeah. 
Natasha: He had widows implanted all over the world. Melina will need to copy the formula, but you should be the one to tell ’em it’s over.

Natasha: What, are you scrapping together some parts? What’d you get me this time, like, an upside-down lawnmower?
Rick Mason: You see what I can get you with a bit of time and money? Go on, say it. I wanna hear it. It would really be good for me to hear it. Really.
Natasha: I’m impressed.
Rick Mason: Well, yeah.
Natasha: You’ve always been a really good friend to me.
Rick Mason: That’s what every man wants to hear. Where you gonna go?
Natasha: It’s funny. My whole life, I didn’t think I had any family. Turns out I got two, so… One of them’s a bit of a mess right now. I’m gonna go break a few of them out of prison see if I can’t help patch things up. (SIGHS)

Valentina: Okay.
Yelena: I want a raise.
Valentina: Oh, yeah. You and me both. Believe me, you’re gonna earn it. I’ve got your next target. Thought I’d hand-deliver it. Maybe you’d like a shot at the man responsible for your sister’s death. Kind of a cutie, don’t you think? (Shows Yelena a photo of Clint Barton)
