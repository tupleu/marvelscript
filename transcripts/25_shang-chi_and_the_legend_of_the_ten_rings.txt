Ying Li: Where I’m from, we are empowered by the magic of the Great Protector. When you have the heart of our dragon, you can do some amazing things.

(TYRES SCREECHING)
Shang-Chi: I knew Katy was trouble the first day we met in high school. I was getting picked on a lot, for all the reasons we all get picked on a lot. Plus, I had just moved to the US, so I was struggling with my English, and I was on my way to lunch one day when this guy who was like twice my size yells at me from down the hall, “What’s up, Gangnam Style?”. So I yelled back, “I’m not Korean, idiot.”
Katy: And I turn the corner, and I see this guy drop his backpack, he’s getting all up in his face…
Shang-Chi: And right before he was about to throw the first punch, Katy comes out of nowhere, steps right between us and starts screaming the lyrics to Hotel California.
John: What?
Katy: It’s the art of confusion. Works great on stupid people.
Shang-Chi: And that’s how we met.
Katy: Then I pulled him into the parking lot… 
Shang-Chi: At which point she revealed that she had also swiped the keys to the guy’s Mustang.
Katy: Yeah, we went on a little joyride around the block. And your wife was in the car, too.
Shang-Chi: That’s true. You were.
John: What?
Soo: I was just in the back seat.
Katy: That’s a part of the car.
Shang-Chi: That’s still a part of the car.
John: How have you never told me this story?
Katy: You know, before she was a lawyer, your girl was pretty wild.
John: Oh! What happened?
Soo: I grew up.
Katy: What’s that supposed to mean?
Shang-Chi: Yeah, what’s that supposed to mean?
Soo: That maybe there’s a point where you’re supposed to stop going on joyrides and start thinking about living up to your potential.
Katy: Please tell me you’re kidding, Soo.
Soo: Look, we’re now living in a world where at any moment half the population can just disappear. Life’s too short and too fragile. Katy, you’re a valet driver with an honours degree from Berkeley, and Shaun can speak, like, four languages. You’ve always been the most talented people I know. I just don’t get why you’re scared to actually use it for something serious.
Shang-Chi: Wow.
Katy: You sound like my mom. You also… dress like her a little bit, too. Where’s this from, Talbots?
(Soo LAUGHS)
Katy: We’re not running from adulthood. How is it running to have jobs that you actually like?
Shang-Chi: Yeah, that doesn’t even make any sense.
Katy: (FUMBLES) Did you think valet parking is easy?
Shang-Chi: It’s like the most challenging job ever. You need people skills, driving skills…
Katy: Soo can’t even parallel park.

Mrs Chen: Shaun, did my daughter apply to any new jobs this week?
Shang-Chi: She really likes her job. We both do.

Katy: Well, on that note, I think we’re gonna miss our bus.
Shang-Chi: Mm.
Katy: I’m sorry for my unacceptable job. And for staying out late last night, trying to enjoy my life. But one day, I’ll make you proud, I promise.

Xu Wenwu: The truth is, I’ve had many names throughout my life. The Warrior King, Master Khan, the most dangerous man on Earth. For years, I thought that was all I was meant to be. But when I met their mother, everything changed.
(SOFT TRADITIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Xu Wenwu: She showed me a part of myself I didn’t know was there. It was like I was seeing the world for the first time.
(CONVERSING IN MANDARIN)

Ying Li: (IN MANDARIN) You know who’s in there? Say, “Hello, little sister!”
(LI GIGGLES)
Xu Wenwu: After all those years, I finally found something worth growing old for. My real name is Wenwu. She was the only one who called me that. And when she died… I was lost for many years. But I’m not lost any more. When you children ran away, I was so desperate to connect with your mother, I threw myself back into the studies of her village. The legendary Ta Lo. I wasn’t able to find the secret path to the village entrance, but I did find what they are hiding. There’s a gate deep in their mountains. Your mother is waiting for us there. I know this is a lot. I might not have believed it if she didn’t tell me herself.
Xu Xialing: What are you talking about?
Xu Wenwu: I was sitting right here in this seat, deep in my research… and she spoke to me. It was like she was standing in this room. I could feel her breath on my cheek and her hand on my back. She told me she needs my help.
Shang-Chi: To do what?
Xu Wenwu: To save her from her people. After we fell in love, your mother wanted us to live in Ta Lo. She asked permission from the elders, and they refused. They said I wasn’t worthy. She would still be with us. We would all be living there together. Ta Lo did this to us. They locked her behind that gate to punish her. Don’t you see? She’s leaving clues for us. She wants us to find her and bring her home, so we can be a family again.
Shang-Chi: Dad, Mom’s gone. She’s not talking to you from behind a gate, and she’s not leaving any clues for us.
Xu Wenwu: Then what are these?
(MYSTICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
(SOFT WHOOSHING)
Xu Wenwu: The passage to Ta Lo is guarded by a moving maze. But there’s a direct path through the forest that only opens once a year on Qingming Jie. To get through, you need to know the route and the exact time it opens. Now I know both. Three days from now, we will rescue my wife from her prison and bring her home.
(ALL RESPOND IN MANDARIN)
Xu Wenwu: This is why you’re here. To help me bring her back to us.
Xu Xialing: And what happens if they don’t let you open the gate?
Xu Wenwu: We’ll burn the village to the ground.
Shang-Chi: What? You can’t just march into our mom’s village with this bullshit. I mean, do you have any idea how insane…
(Shang-Chi GRUNTING)
(GASPS)
Katy: Hey!
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)
Katy: Where are you taking me?
Xu Wenwu: (IN MANDARIN) When will you stop pretending? (IN ENGLISH) Lock them up.
Dweller-in-Darkness: (IN MANDARIN) It’s okay, my dear. We’re all going to be together Soon.
Katy: (IN ENGLISH) So, um, pretty confused right now, because, uh, initially I thought your dad should definitely see a therapist for his delusions, but then that dragon vomited a magical water map, and now I have no idea what’s real. Is what he said about your mom’s village true?
(SIGHS)
Shang-Chi: She used to tell us stories about Ta Lo when we were kids. A village in another dimension full of magical creatures. I thought it was just a fairy tale.
Xu Xialing: What if Dad’s right?
Shang-Chi: About Mom being locked behind a gate by her own people?
Xu Xialing: Crazier things have turned out to be true.
Shang-Chi: Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on, but if we don’t find a way to get to Ta Lo before him, he’s gonna destroy everything that’s left of our family.
Xu Xialing: This family was destroyed a long time ago.

Katy: Who are you?
Trevor Slattery:  Trevor? Slattery? The actor from Liverpool? Wait. Are you the governor’s kids? I’ve been preparing a monologue for your homecoming dinner. Oh. Where’s she going?
Katy: Why are you down here?
Trevor Slattery:  Well, some time ago, I was offered the role of a terrorist. I know, facile, trite, I couldn’t agree more. But times were lean, you know what I mean? Anyway, the producer told me he worked for the BBC. But, ironic twist, it turns out he, in fact, was a terrorist, and I wasn’t playing a character at all, but what I now recognise to be a rather unflattering portrait of your father. We all got our just deserts. The producer got blown up by Iron Man, and I served time in federal prison, which turned out to be the best thing for me. I got clean, I rediscovered my passion.
Shang-Chi: Then my dad broke you out?
Trevor Slattery:  Exactly.
Shang-Chi: To kill you.
Trevor Slattery:  Exactly. But just as his men were tying me up for my execution, I launched into a performance of my Macbeth. “Whence is that knocking? Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would’st though could’st…” They couldn’t get enough of it. I’ve been doing weekly gigs for the lads ever since.
Katy: So you’re like his jester?
Trevor Slattery:  I can give you a quick preview if you like. “Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle…”
Shang-Chi: Uh, thank you, Trevor. I think we’re okay. Right now, we really just need to find a way to…

Trevor Slattery:  (CHUCKLES) If he didn’t talk to me, I’d have gone mad yonks ago.
Shang-Chi: How would he know me? 
Trevor Slattery:  He says he grew up with your mum. In Ta Lo. Apparently, your father picked him up in some magic forest on one of his expeditions to find the entrance.
(MORRIS PURRING AND COOING)
Trevor Slattery:  He wants you to take him home.
(MORRIS COOING)
Shang-Chi: Believe me, buddy, I would if I knew how. According to my dad, the path there only opens once a year.
(MORRIS CHITTERING)
Trevor Slattery:  Oh. (CHUCKLES)
(CONTINUES CHITTERING)
Trevor Slattery:  Morris says he can guide you there right now. You can get through the maze without waiting for the path to open. But, and it’s a big “but,” it’s very dangerous.

Xu Wenwu: They will come back once I bring her home. Prepare the men for war.
Razor Fist: Yes, sir.
Trevor Slattery:  The first time I witnessed pure artistry. 1968. Planet of the Apes. I was sitting in the cinema next to my mum, watching mastery unfold before my very eyes. After the film, I asked her, “How did they get those monkeys to do those things?” And she patted me on the head and she said, “It’s not real, pet. It’s just acting.” That’s when I knew. If they can teach those monkeys to act that brilliantly, just imagine what I could bring to the world.
Shang-Chi: So you became an actor because you thought the monkeys were actually…
Trevor Slattery:  Riding horses? I did. Yes. When, in fact, they were simply acting as if they were riding horses. I still can’t get my head round it, to be honest.
Katy: Good for you, dude. You found your passion and went for it, and eventually used it to cripple the US government, but whatever.
Trevor Slattery:  Yeah. No, yeah, thanks.
Shang-Chi: Um, this is really cool and all, but how long do we have to sit here?
Trevor Slattery:  Morris is very clear. The way through is all about timing.
Shang-Chi: Okay, but how long are we talking? Like, hours? Days?
Trevor Slattery:  Friends, I am but a transitory vessel for the infinite wisdom of a creature far more advanced than we’ll ever truly understand. What he sees, what he feels of this vast, unknown universe is beyond anything our simple brains can…

(SIGHS SOFTLY)
(VILLAGERS CHATTERING)
Ying Nan: Our people have been here for over 4,000 years, preparing for something we hope will never happen. We are the keepers of the Dark Gate, sworn to protect this realm and yours from the evil that’s locked behind it.
Shang-Chi: Our dad is coming here to open that gate. He thinks you’re holding our mom there.
Ying Nan: Why would he think that?
Xu Xialing: She told him. He says he can hear her asking for help.
IYing Nan: Is he wearing the rings?
Shang-Chi: He hasn’t taken them off since she died. What do they have to do with all this?
Ying Nan: The realm of Ta Lo stretches far beyond the shores of our small village. We have cities that surpass any in your universe, rich with culture and history. Thousands of years ago, all of our people lived in peace and prosperity, until the attack of the Dweller-in-Darkness. He came with his army, devouring every soul in their path, and with each kill, they grew stronger. After decimating our largest cities, they were headed to your universe to do the same. The leaders of Ta Lo sent their strongest warriors here to stop them from reaching the portal to your world. But our ancestors were no match for them. Until The Great Protector joined their fight and turned the tide. Together, they pushed the Dweller and his army into the Dark Gate and locked it behind them. Our people have guarded that gate ever since, empowered by the magic of The Great Protector and the gift that she gave us.
(WEAPON POWERS UP)
(Katy GASPS)
Ying Nan: Dragon scales. Makes very good armour. Your father isn’t the first to come here to open the Dark Gate. Many have tried and failed over the centuries, and they all had one thing in common. They were lured here by the voice of something on the other side. A voice that promised them their greatest desires.
Shang-Chi: So you think soul eaters are talking to our dad?
Ying Nan: They know The Ten Rings have the power to break them free.
(Katy GASPS)

Katy: I seriously thought we were going to die. And I’d only learned how to shoot a bow, like, a day earlier, now I’m on a battlefield, killing all these Soul Suckers with Shaun’s aunty, who’s this awesome, magical kung fu goddess.
Shang-Chi: And I’m hanging on to The Great Protector with my sister at this point, trying not to get eaten by the Mega Soul Sucker.
Katy: Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker was such a nasty bitch.
Shang-Chi: Yeah. It was trying to eat our dragon’s soul.
Katy: Which would have allowed it to destroy the entire universe.
Shang-Chi: Yeah.
Katy: I only had one arrow left, and all I could hear in the back of my mind was my mom’s voice saying, “Just take the shot, you little mooch!” And so, I aimed right for the Sucker’s throat and I let her fly.
Shang-Chi: She hit it dead on.
Katy: And then Shaun used the Ten Rings to do this crazy Kamehameha fireball that exploded the thing…
(MOUTHING)
Katy: …and he saved the world.
Shang-Chi: Yeah, we, uh, lost some good people that day… but we made it.
Katy: We made it.
Soo: Are you done mocking me?
Katy: Oh, no. We’re not mocking you.
Soo: So where is this sister of yours?
Shang-Chi: She’s back at my dad’s compound, shutting down his operations.
Katy: Yeah, his dad was the head of The Ten Rings for the past thousand years.
Soo: Two weeks ago, you were parking cars for tips, and you want me to believe you’re now saving the world from soul-sucking monsters? I know, you’re trying to get me back for what I said last time, but I’m not gonna apologise…
(CRACKLING)
Soo: …for speaking the truth as a friend. I really meant what I said, and, in fact, I actually think this whole bit you’re doing just further proves my point. You guys are obviously…
(CRACKLING CONTINUES)
Soo: What?
Wong: Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi.
Shang-Chi: Uh… Here. Present.

Wong: My name is Wong.
Shang-Chi: Yeah, I know, sir. I’m a huge fan…
Wong: Do you have the rings?
Shang-Chi: Uh… Yeah, yes.
Wong: Good. Let’s go, we have a lot to talk about. You too.
(WONG EXHALES LOUDLY)
Katy: Me too?
Shang-Chi: I think we should…
Katy: Yeah. (MUMBLES)
Shang-Chi: Uh, we gotta go.
Katy: Yeah. I know this is, like, crazy, but I’m gonna text you, and we’ll do this again. Nice to see you, John.
Shang-Chi: I’ll Venmo you for the…

Wong: Hmm. They don’t match any artefacts from our codex. What do you think?
Bruce: Mm, I’m not sure. They’re not vibranium. Chitauri?
Carol Danvers: Not like any alien tech I’ve seen. How long did your dad have them before he gave them to you?
Shang-Chi: Um… About a thousand years.
Bruce: Their thermoluminescence indicates they’re older than that. By a lot.
Wong: The first time you used the rings, we felt it in Kamar-Taj.
Katy: What is it?
Carol Danvers: A beacon.
Bruce: They’re sending a message.

Wong: I know this is a lot to take in, but you’re gonna have to start getting used to that. From now on, the trajectory of your lives will be like nothing you’ve ever experienced before. And there’s no going back. You both have a long journey ahead of you. Go home, get some rest.
Katy: Yeah. That’s a good idea.
Shang-Chi: Yeah. Yeah, we probably should do that. Or…
