FADE IN:
1 EXT. FROZEN WASTELAND - DAY 1
Show whips. Headlights approach. A HIGH-TECH HMUV grinds
through an ARCTIC SNOWSTORM. The HMUV stops. TWO SHIELD MEN
get out. The whipping snow is deafening. They can barely see.
The SEARCH TEAM LEADER, a CIVILIAN, meets them, offering his
hand.
SEARCH TEAM LEADER
(shouting over the wind)
You the guys from Washington?
SHIELD LT.
That’s some flight
ALT. Get many other visitors out
here?
SHIELD TECH
How long have you been on site?
SEARCH TEAM LEADER
Since this morning. A Russian oil
team called it in about 18 hours
ago.
SHIELD LT.
How come nobody spotted it before?
SEARCH TEAM LEADER
(gesturing around them)
Ice melts. Storms blow in.
Landscape changes all the time.
The Search Leader gets a worried look.
SEARCH TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
You mind if I ask what this thing
is, exactly?
SHIELD LT.
Would you believe us if we said it
was a weather balloon?
SEARCH TEAM LEADER
No.
The SHIELD men stare. The team leader shrugs and walks on.
(CONTINUED)
SEARCH TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
Listen, for the record, I’m not
sure we have the equipment for a
job like thisSHIELD LT.
Is the sonar up and running yet?
SEARCH TEAM LEADER
Sure. We’re getting deep ice
preliminaries now. Very deep.
SHIELD TECH
So? How long before we can start
craning it out?
He stops the Shield Tech, a bit incredulous.
SEARCH TEAM LEADER
I don’t think you quite
understand...
The Search Team Leader points at something off screen.
SEARCH TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
You guys are going to need one hell
of a crane.
THE TWO SHIELD MEN look off screen, awestruck.
REVEAL: A MASSIVE WINGTIP JUTS FROM THE ICE, TOWERING ABOVE
THEM LIKE A SKYSCRAPER.
A SKULL AND TENTACLE LOGO is just visible through the ice.
German words are stenciled ominously below.

PITCH BLACK. The laser burns through, cutting a hole. The
metal circle drops, letting in a shaft of light.
THE TWO SHIELD OPERATIVES FROM THE HMUV RAPPEL DOWN THE
ROPES.

They creep through THE FROZEN, DEVASTATED PLANE.
Shattered control screens reflect their flashlights.
THE LIEUTENANT eyes a panel, "GEFAHR. EXPLOSIVSTOFFE."
SHIELD LT. (INTO RADIO)
This has got to be World War II.
But the Luftwaffe didn’t have
anything nearly this advanced.
(beat)
Or this big.
SHIELD TECH
Lieutenant?
SHIELD LT. (INTO RADIO)
Hold that, Base.
THE TECH chips at AN ICE FLOE, then stops.
SHIELD TECH
What is it?
The lieutenant stares, awed.
SHIELD LT. (INTO RADIO)
Base, get me a line to the colonel.
I don’t care what time it is.
(beat)
This one’s worth waking up for.
He knocks away the last of the ice, revealing...A RED, WHITE
AND BLUE SHIELD.
5 EXT. FROZEN WASTELAND - NIGHT 5
A SNOWCAT HAULS OUT A HUGE BLOCK OF ICE. THE SHIELD IS BARELY
VISIBLE INSIDE.
6 EXT. CASTLE ROCK TOWER - NIGHT 6
TWO PARTISANS race across the cobblestones. AN OMINOUS
CLANKING FILL THE AIR.
ERIK
(subtitled Norwegian)
Go and tell the Keeper! Hurry!
TITLE: "NORWAY, MAY 1942."

JAN RUNS. ERIK sets a MOLOTOV down and checks his rifle. THE
MOLOTOV TOPPLES ON THE COBBLESTONES. THE OMINOUS CLANKING
RISES UNTIL...A HUGE TANK, THE LANDKRUEZER, CRASHES THROUGH A
BUILDING.
Erik pales at the HYDRA LOGO. He runs, but MACHINE GUNS CUT
HIM DOWN.
6A EXT. CASTLE ROCK TOWER - NIGHT 6A
Jan races toward the front door of a lonely STONE TOWER.
7 INT. CASTLE ROCK TOWER - NIGHT 7
Jan slams down a huge timber crossbeam, locking the door.
JAN
They’re coming!
AN OLD TOWER KEEPER rushes downstairs.
TOWER KEEPER
They’ll never find it.
The two men turn as...THE OMINOUS CLANKING RISES OUTSIDE. THE
LANDKREUZER PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL. BRICKS AND TIMBER RAIN
DOWN, KNOCKING THE KEEPER BACK. WHEN THE DUST SUBSIDES, THE
KEEPER STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET, ONLY TO FIND JAN DEAD AMIDST
THE RUBBLE.
HYDRA TROOPS POUR IN, SURROUNDING HIM.

10 EXT. CASTLE ROCK TOWER - NIGHT 10
A MODIFIED CAR pulls up, ITS HOOD ORNAMENT A HYRDA SKULL.
GLEAMING JACKBOOTS STEP OUT ONTO THE COBBLESTONES.
11 INT. CASTLE ROCK TOWER - NIGHT 11
THE HYDRA SOLDIERS THROW THE KEEPER DOWN IN FRONT OF A STONE
SARCOPHAGUS IN AN ORNATE CRYPT.
The soldiers try but FAIL TO PUSH THE MASSIVE COFFIN LID.

(CONTINUED)
HYDRA LIEUTENANT
Quickly, before heThen, FOOTSTEPS. The soldiers snap to attention as...A HYDRA
OFFICER, JOHANN SCHMIDT, STEPS THROUGH THE RUBBLE. HIS EYES
ARE SUNKEN, HIS SKIN PALE AND WAXY.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
It has taken me a long time to find
this place. You should be
commended.
He stands before the tower keeper.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Give me what I want, and you will
find the Reich most appreciative.
TOWER KEEPER
I give you nothing.
A HYDRA GUARD moves to clock the old man, but Schmidt waves
him off. He leans over the tower keeper.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
You are a man of great vision. In
that, we are much alike.
TOWER KEEPER
I am nothing like you.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Oh, no, no. I don’t suggest that.
Schmidt sees his men struggling with the coffin lid.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
But what others see as
superstition, you and I know to be
science. The oldest science.
TOWER KEEPER
What you seek is just a legend.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Then why do you try so hard to hide
it?
Schmidt strides to the coffin. He heaves the heavy lid aside.
It smashes to the floor. Inside, A DESICCATED CORPSE
holds...A CRYSTAL CUBE.
5.
11 CONTINUED: 11
(CONTINUED)
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
The Tesseract was the Jewel of
Odin’s treasure room.
He turns it over in his hand, curious...THEN DROPS IT TO THE
FLOOR. IT SHATTERS.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
It is not a thing one buries.
HE LIFTS THE OLD MAN BY THE SHOULDER, HISSING IN HIS EAR.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
But it is close, yes?
TOWER KEEPER
I cannot help you.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Bo. But you can help them.
He turns the old man to see THE TANK POINTING AT THE TOWN.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
You have friends out there.
Grandchildren, perhaps. I’ve no
need for them to die.
Terrified, the tower keeper lets his eyes flick to A WALL.
Schmidt lets the old man down. HE SEARCHES THE WALL, FINALLY
LANDING ON THE CARVING OF A TREE.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Yggdrasil, tree of the world.
Guardian of wisdom...
He scans the ROOTS, finally alighting on...A SERPENT.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
And fate.
He pushes the snake’s eye, releasing A WOODEN BOX CARVED LIKE
A SNAKE. The old man sags, defeated.
Schmidt opens the box. BLUE LIGHT illuminates his face. He
gazes, enraptured. The old man stares, awed.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
And the Fuhrer digs for the
trinkets in the desert...
He looks over at the old man.
6.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
(CONTINUED)
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
You’ve never seen it, have you?
TOWER KEEPER
It’s not for the eyes of ordinary
men.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Exactly.
Schmidt shuts the box. The light disappears. He glances over
at the cannon, almost distractedly.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Commence firing.
A SOLDIER CALLS OUT OFF SCREEN AND THE CANNON ERUPTS.
ENRAGED, THE OLD MAN LUNGES BUT IS HELD BACK BY SOLDIERS.
TOWER KEEPER
Fool. None of us can control that
power. You will burn.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
I already have.
SCHMIDT DRAWS HIS LUGER WITH DAZZLING SPEED. BLAM. THE KEEPER
DROPS. The old man’s blood has spattered Schmidt’s HYDRA
LAPEL PIN. His tentacled death’s head is now a RED SKULL.
12 INT. ENLISTMENT OFFICE, BAYONNE, N.J. - DAY 12
A PAPER SCREAMS: "ELITE NAZI FORCES OVERRUN NORWEGIAN TOWN."
ARMY DOCTOR (O.S.)
O’Connell, Michael...
The paper flaps down, revealing a young man. He stands,
wearing only boxer shorts.
TITLE: "NEW YORK CITY, JUNE 1943."
DOZENS OF HALF-DRESSED RECRUITS read newspapers, waiting for
their exam results.
ANOTHER PAPER: "U-BOATS TORPEDO SHIP OFF COAST OF VIRGINIA."
ARMY DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Kaminsky, Henry...
Kaminsky stands, tossing his paper aside. He glances at the
next newsreader down.

11 CONTINUED: (3) 11
(CONTINUED)
CLOSE ON: THE PAPER, "NAZIS BURN CZECH VILLAGE TO THE
GROUND."
HENRY KAMINSKY
Kinda makes you think twice about
enlisting, huh?
STEVE ROGERS LOWERS HIS PAPER. He’s frail and small.
STEVE
Nope.
ARMY DOCTOR (O.S.)
Rogers, Steven.
Steve folds the paper and gets to his feet.
TIME CUT:
Steve anxiously watches AN ARMY DOCTOR scan his file.
CLOSE ON: STEVE’S FILE. A dozen ailments have been checked.
ARMY DOCTOR (CONT’D)
What did your father die of?
STEVE
Mustard gas.
The doctor looks up.
STEVE (CONT’D)
1918. He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping to get assigned to
them ifARMY DOCTOR
And your mother?
STEVE
Few years back, she was a nurse in
the TB ward. Got hit, couldn’t
shake it.
Finally, THE DOCTOR SHAKES HIS HEAD.
STEVE (CONT’D)
They weren’t weak, Doc; they were
fighters. If you just give me aARMY DOCTOR
Sorry, son. You’d be ineligible on
your asthma alone.

ARMY DOCTOR

THE DOCTOR STAMPS STEVE’S FILE: 4F.
13 INT. MOVIE THEATER, NEW YORK CITY - DAY 13
SPINNING MATCH CUT: A SWASTIKA FLUTTERS ON A FLAG. A NEWSREEL
FLICKERS. A COLUMN OF NAZIS STOMPS DOWN A ROAD.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
As Hitler’s troops continue to
ravage Occupied Europe...
Steve sits in the audience, watching intently.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
On the home front, enlistment
centers teem with the able-bodied,
eager to help our allies.
A LINE OF MEN SNAKES OUT A RECRUITING OFFICE.
LOUD JERK (O.S.)
They’re just tryin’ to get outa
workin’ for a living.
A FEW ROWS AHEAD, A MAN SHOUTS BACK AT THE SCREEN.
Steve looks across the aisle. A YOUNG WOMAN watches the
screen, tears welling. She clearly has a man overseas. Across
the aisle, a middle-aged Jewish couple looks somber.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Across the seas, our brave boys are
already showing the Axis that the
price of freedom is never too high!
Soldiers-some wounded-wave at the camera, their smiles almost
convincing.
LOUD JERK (O.S.)
Jeez, play the cartoon, already!
Steve sees the woman flinch. He whispers to the man:
STEVE
Can you keep it down, please?

12 CONTINUED: (2) 12

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Together with the allied forces,
they march toward freedom and
liberation for millions of grateful
citizens.
A KID PULLS HIS WAGON. A HAND-DRAWN SIGN SAYS "SCRAP METAL."
LOUD JERK (O.S.)
Let ‘em clean up their own mess,
the jerks!
Steve leans over, fuming. He jabs the man in the shoulder.
STEVE
YOU WANT TO SHUT UP?
The man slowly rises from his slumped position. He
rises...and rises, revealing...A VERY LARGE JERK.
14 EXT. MOVIE THEATER, ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON 14
WHAM! The jerk hammers Steve in the jaw, knocking him into a
line of garbage cans. Steve groans...and GETS BACK UP.
Steve’s a natural fighter, bobbing and scoring a kidney
punch, but the guy barely feels it. The jerk swings. STEVE
tries to BLOCK WITH A TRASH CAN LID. The jerk yanks away the
lid and pounds him again. Steve’s feet lift off the ground.
HE HITS THE CEMENT HARD. For a moment, Steve lays still. The
jerk hovers, panting. THEN STEVE GETS TO HIS FEET AGAIN. The
jerk shakes his head.
LOUD JERK
You just don’t know when to give
up, do you?
STEVE
(wiping his bloody mouth)
I can do this all day.
The jerk knocks Steve back into a pile of garbage. He moves
to hit him...BUT SOMEONE GRABS HIS ARM.
BUCKY (O.S.)
What’s with all the fighting?
The jerk spins to see A SOLDIER, JAMES "BUCKY" BARNES.
BUCKY (CONT’D)
Don’t you know there’s a war on?
10.
13 CONTINUED: 13
(CONTINUED)
The jerk takes a swing. Bucky SLUGS him, spins him around,
and PLANTS an army boot in the ass. The jerk runs away. Bucky
looks down at Steve, getting up from a pile of garbage.
BUCKY (CONT’D)
Sometimes I think you like getting
punched.
STEVE
I hade him on the ropes.
As Steve gets up, a folded ENLISTMENT FORM falls from his
pocket. Bucky picks it up and reads.
BUCKY
How many times is this?
(reads)
And you’re from Paramus now? It’s
still illegal to lie on an
enlistment form, and seriously,
Jersey?
Steve frowns, TAKING IN BUCKY’S UNIFORM.
STEVE
Looks like you got your orders.
BUCKY
107th ships to England first thing
tomorrow.
(beat)
This is my last night.
STEVE
So, what’s the first stop. Church?
Bucky grins.
BUCKY
Yeah...maybe second stop.
They start walking out of the alley.
STEVE
Where are we going?
He whips out a newspaper and hands it to Steve.
BUCKY
The future.

14 CONTINUED: 14

Steve opens the paper. An ad reads, "WORLD EXHIBITION OF
TOMORROW." MONORAILS RACE AROUND FUTURISTIC BUILDINGS.
DISSOLVE TO:
15 OMITTED 15
16 EXT. WORLD EXPOSITION OF TOMORROW, MIDWAY - NIGHT 16
A MONORAIL SPEEDS OVER AN EPIC FAIR. Steve and Bucky walk
down the busy midway.
BUCKY
I don’t see what the problem is.
You’re about to be the last
eligible man in New York. You know
there’re three and a half million
women here?
STEVE
I’d settle for just one.
Bucky waves at somebody in the distance.
BUCKY
Good thing I’ve taken care of that.
Across the midway, TWO GIRLS WAVE BACK in front of THE MODERN
MARVELS PAVILION.
STEVE
What’d you tell her about me?
Bucky grins, still waving.
BUCKY
Only the good stuff.
17 INT. MARVELS PAVILION - NIGHT 17
EXHIBITS LINE THE HALL. A GLASS BOX holds a RED-SUITED
ANDROID.
"DR. PHINEAS HORTON PRESENTS...THE SYNTHETIC MAN!:
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER rests at the base. Bucky and the two
girls (CONNIE and BONNIE) hurry past the exhibit. Steve tags
after, ignored.

CONNIE
Oh my God, there he is!
The girls squeal, urging Bucky towards:
18 INT. MARVELS PAVILION, STARK STAGE - NIGHT 18
A crowd gathers by a stage: "STARK INDUSTRIES PRESENTS..."
Steve buys PEANUTS as Bucky and the girls get in close. On
stage, a dashing HOWARD STARK stands with a 1942 CADILLAC.
The girls giggle, smitten.
HOWARD STARK
Ladies, you know how hard it can be
putting on makeup in a car that’s
bouncing like a kangaroo on a
trampoline.
Steve offers Bonnie a peanut. She looks at them with scorn.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
What if I told you that in just a
few short years, your automobile
wouldn’t touch the ground at all?
Stark hits a button. THE CADILLAC RISES, LEAVING ITS TIRE ON
THE GROUND, BULKY DEVICES WHERE THE WHEELS SHOULD BE. The
crowd gasps. Bucky and Steve gape, impressed.
BUCKY
Ho-ly cow.
HOWARD STARK
With Stark Gravitic Reversion
Technology (patent pending), you’ll
be able to do just thaThere’s a POP and AN EXPLOSION. THE CAR SLAMS TO THE STAGE.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
I did say a few years, didn’t I?
The audience applauds. As Bonnie swoons over Howard, Steve
looks around, sheepish. He spots something in the distance.
Bucky wraps his arm around Connie.
BUCKY
Hey, Steve. What do you say we
treat these ladiesBut Steve’s gone. In his place, a LITTLE GIRL digs eagerly
into his bag of peanuts.

17 CONTINUED: 17
19 INT. MARVELS PAVILION, RECRUITMENT CENTER - NIGHT 19
STEVE stares at A MIRRORED BOOTH in front of THE RECRUITING
PAVILION: "YOU DUTY: TYR IT ON FOR SIZE!"
A BURLY MAN stands in front of the mirror. He looks big and
heroic in uniform. Now Steve steps up. In the mirror, he now
wears A G.I. UNIFORM. HIS DISAPPOINTED EYES BARELY SEE OVER
THE COLLAR. Just then, Bucky clamps a hand on his shoulder.
BUCKY
You’re kind of missing the point of
a "double date." Come on, we’re
gonna get a chocolate soda.
STEVE
You go ahead.
Nearby we see Dr. Erskine, A TIRED-LOOKING MAN in his mid50s, listening in on the argument.
Bucky eyes the recruitment signs.
BUCKY
You’re really gonna do this now?
STEVE
It’s a fair. I’m gonna try my luck.
BUCKY
As who? "Steve from Ohio"? They’ll
catch you. Or worse, they’ll
actually take you.
Steve looks at Bucky with a grim smile of disappointment.
STEVE
You don’t think I can do it.
BUCKY
This isn’t some back alley, Steve.
It’s a war. Why are you so keen to
fight? There’re lots of other
important jobsSTEVE
You want me to sit in a factory?
Collect scrap metal in my little
red wagon while the men are laying
down their lives? I can do as well
as them and I got no right to do
any less.

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
That’s the thing you don’t get,
Bucky. It’s not about me.
BUCKY
Right. ‘Cause you’ve got nothing to
prove.
A tense beat passes between them.
CONNIE
Hey Sarge, we gettin’ sodas?
BUCKY
Yeah. We are.
Annoyed, Bucky walks toward Connie. Then, he stops, torn.
Finally, he turns back to steve. Bucky holds out his hand.
Steve sees his friend’s genuine worry. He shakes his hand.
BUCKY (CONT’D)
Promise me you won’t do anything
too stupid before I get back.
STEVE
Remember, when you attack, you run
toward the enemy.
ALT. I can’t. You’re taking all the
stupid with you.
BUCKY
(affectionately)
You’re a punk.
STEVE
(affectionately)
You’re a jerk.
A moment, and Bucky turns to go. He spins as he goes, for a
last little wave...
STEVE (CONT’D)
Don’t win the war till I get there.
And Bucky goes, swooping up Connie under his arm. Steve turns
to the tent.
20 INT. RECRUITMENT PAVILION - NIGHT 20
A YOUNG DOCTOR rips a blood pressure cuff of Steve’s arm.

A NURSE ENTERS AND WHISPERS TO THE DOCTOR, WHO EYES STEVE.
YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Wait here.
STEVE
Am I in trouble?
YOUNG DOCTOR
Just wait here.
He and the nurse leave. Steve eyes a POSTER:
"IT IS ILLEGAL TO FALSIFY YOU ENLISTMENT FORM. ONLY TRAITORS
LIE TO THEIR COUNTRY."
As Steve SCRAMBLES for his shoes...AN MP SLIDES OPEN THE
CURTAIN. STEVE LOOKS UP AT THE TOWERING SOLDIER.
STEVE
I’m in trouble.
DR. ERSKINE enters, wearing a lab coat, looking at a file.
DR. ERSKINE
So, you want to go overseas, kill
some Nazis?
STEVE
Excuse me?
DR. ERSKINE
(offers hand)
I’m Doctor Abraham Erskine. I
represent the Strategic Scientific
Reserve.
STEVE
(shaking hands)
Steve Rogers. Where are you from ?
DR. ERSKINE
Queens. 73rd and Utopia Parkway.
And before that, German. This
troubles you?
Steve considers this, then shrugs.

DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
And where are you from, Mr. Rogers?
Is it New Haven, or Paramus, or...
(reading the file)
Five exams. In five different
cities...
STEVE
That might not be the right fileDR. ERSKINE
It is not the exams I am interested
in. It is the five tries.
(peering at Steve)
You didn’t answer my question. You
want to kill Nazis?
STEVE
Is this a test?
DR. ERSKINE
Yes.
STEVE
I don’t like bullies, Doctor. I
don’t care where they’re from.
DR. ERSKINE
There are already plenty of big
strapping men in this war. What
they need now is maybe the "little
guys," yea?
STEVE
Maybe. What do you do, exactly?
DR. ERSKINE
ALT. Let’s say I believe there is
great potential in every human.
It’s just a matter of bringing it
to the surface.
Erskine lays out Steve’s file. He reaches for a stamp.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
I can offer you a chance, only a
chance.
STEVE
That’s all I’m asking for.

22 INT. HYDRA HQ, SCHMIDT’S OFFICE LAB - DAY 22
DR. ARNIM ZOLA’S DISTORTED FACE FILLS A MONITOR.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
My machine requires the most
delicate calibration.
PULL BACK to see Zola actually standing across the room,
peering into A CAMERA. The camera is trained at...
AN EMPTY CRADLE IN THE CENTER OF A COMPLICATED MACHINE.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA (CONT’D)
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.
JOHANN SCHMIDT makes adjustments to a conduit attached to A
LARGE BATTERY.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Are you certain the conductors will
withstand the energy surge long
enough for the transference?
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
With this...artifact...I am certain
of nothing.
Zola eyes MORE CONDUITS snaking from the battery to A CRUDE
CANNON. A small, WOODEN TARGET awaits.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA (CONT’D)
In fact, I fear this may not work
at all.

Schmidt glances at THE CARVED BOX FROM NORWAY on a table.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Then we have lost only time,
Doctor. But if it does work...
ANCIENT TOMES SPREAD OUT AROUND IT. We can see images we
already know:
A MAMMOTH TREE...A SNAKE HIDDEN IN ITS ROOTS.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
In a matter of minutes, we might
control the power of the gods.
Either way...
His eyes flick over another engraving: A GLOWING, CUBE LAYS
WASTE TO A HORDE OF BARBARIANS.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
It is a moment of terrible
possibility.
SCHMIDT THEN OPENS THE BOX. BLINDING BLUE LIGHT SHOOTS OUT.
Zola secures his sunglasses.
Schmidt lists out AN INCREDIBLY BRIGHT OBJECT OF PURE ENERGY.
He rests it in the cradle. A SMOKED-GLASS SHIELD DROPS DOWN,
covering the chamber. Through the glass, we now see the
outlines of A CUBE.
SCHMIDT TURNS A DIAL. THE CUBE PULSES. A GAUGE marked
:ENERGIENBATTERIE" glows blue, beginning to rise: 20%...40%
...60%... But the battery remains cold. Dark.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
We are stable at seventy percent.
Well within safety parameters.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
I did not come all this way for
safety, Doctor.
Schmidt reaches over and TURNS THE DIAL. 80%...90%...
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
At those levels the power may be
uncontrollSchmidt cranks the dial. 100%. THE CUBE SURGES OTHERWORLDLY
POWER BURSTS FROM THE CUBE IN A BURNING FLASH. IT FLOODS THE
CONDUITS, FULLING THE EMPTY BATTERY WITH BLUE ENERGY.

22 CONTINUED: 22
(CONTINUED)
JUST AS IT APPEARS THE BATTERY WILL BURST...THE ENERGY
FLASHES IN A SWIRLING RUSH OF LIGHTNING.
SCHMIDT AND ZOLA GAPE AS, WITHIN THE SWIRLING ENERGY, A
BRIEF, OTHERWORLDLY VISION FORMS. THEN...ZAP. THE VISION
WINKS OUT AS A SEARING BEAM SHOOTS FROM THE GUN, VAPORIZING
THE TARGET, BLASTING A HOLE IN THE WALL BEYOND.
Zola pulls a switch. The cube powers down. BUT THE BATTERY
STILL GLOWS, HUMMING WITH LIFE. Breathless, Zola looks
uneasily to where they saw the vision.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA (CONT’D)
Did you see...
But Schmidt just stares at the destruction around him. He
allows himself a smile.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Thank you, Doctor. Your designs do
not disappoint...
THE CONDUITS, LIKE THE WALL OF THE LAB, LIE IN RUINS.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Though they may require
reinforcement.
Zola takes a reading at a gauge, impressed.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
The exchange is stable. Amazing.
The energy we’ve just collected
could power a battleship. Ten
battleships.
(beat)
This will change the war.
Schmidt pours himself a whiskey, hand shaking. He drinks.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Doctor Zola. This will change the
world.

She passes out papers and clipboards.
PEGGY CARTER (CONT’D)
To begin with, I shall need you to
complete this document.
Steve reads it: "LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT." Two guys next to
him look at each other nervously. Steve’s not fazed.
A MEATY GUY, HODGE, grumbles as he takes his papers...
HODGE
What’s with the accent, Queen
Victoria? I thought I was signing
up for the U.S. Army.
PEGGY CARTER
What’s your name, soldier?
HODGE
Gilmore Hodge, your majesty.
PEGGY CARTER
Step forward, Hodge.
He does. She indicates where and how he should stand:
PEGGY CARTER (CONT’D)
Right leg forward, arms like so...
HODGE
(suggestively)
We gonna rassle? ‘Cause I got a few
moves I know you’ll like.
She comes close, also putting one leg forward...

She PUNCHES HIM SQUARE IN THE NOSE. He drops in a heap, eyes
watering, a trickle of blood coming from one nostril.
PEGGY CARTER
(casually)
Neither am I.
The men titter. Steve looks especially pleased.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (O.S.)
Agent Carter!
The men leap to attention as COLONEL PHILLIPS APPROACHES,
impressive, all military. Erskine trails behind him.
PEGGY CARTER
Colonel Phillips.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I see you’re breaking in the
candidates. That’s good.
(to Hodge)
You. Get over there in that line
and stand at attention until
somebody tells you what to do.
Hodge scurries back. Phillips stands before the men.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
General Patton has said that "wars
are fought with weapons and won by
men."
Phillips notices the sickly Steve. He scowls at Erskine.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
We’re going to win this war because
we have the best men... And because
they are going to get better. Much
better.
23A INT. CAMP LEHIGH, BARRACKS - NIGHT 23A
The mane are unloading their gear. HODGE puts up pin-ups of
women.
Steve unpacks a stack of well-worn military books.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (O.S.)
The Strategic Scientific Reserve is
an Allied effort, made up of the
best minds in the free world.

24 EXT. CAMP LEHIGH, OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY 24
Recruits run through AN OBSTACLE COURSE. Steve struggles,
last.
THE RECRUITS SCRAMBLE UP A CARGO NET. STEVE’S FOOT GETS
TANGLED. HODGE CLIMBS OVER HIM, SMASHING HIS FACE. FROM AN
OBSERVATION PLATFORM, ERSKINE WATCHES as Steve grimaces but
hauls himself up.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (O.S.)
Our goal is to create the finest
army in history. But every army
starts with one man.
25 EXT. CAMP LEHIGH, OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY 25
PEGGY CHECKS A STOPWATCH. THE OTHER RECRUITS WAIT AS...STEVE
CRAWLS THROUGH MUD BENEATH A BARBED-WIRE NET.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (O.S.)
By the end of this week, we’re
going to choose that man.
Hodge kicks out a support. THE BARBED WIRE FALLS ON STEVE.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
He’s going to be the first of a new
breed of super soldiers. And they
are personally going to escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.
ALT. He’s going to be the first of
a new breed of super soldiers. And
together they’re going to bring a
quick end to this damn war.
26 OMITTED 26
27 EXT. CAMP LEHIGH, PRACTICE FIELD - DAY 27
STEVE STRUGGLES TO DO A PUSH-UP. Peggy paces as the recruits
do calisthenics.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I guess I just don’t understand the
European sense of humor, Doctor.
PHILLIPS AND ERSKINE WALK TOWARD THEM.
23.
(CONTINUED)
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
You’re not thinking of picking
Rogers, are you?
DR. ERSKINE
I am more than just thinking about
it. He is the clear choice.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
When you invited a ninety-pound
asthmatic onto my Army base, I let
it slide because I assumed he’d be
useful to you. Like a gerbil. I
never thought you’d pick him.
They stop near an open TRUCK, A CRATE OF GRENADES inside.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
You put a needle in that guy’s arm,
it’s gonna come out the other side.
They watch Steve struggling to do his push-ups.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Look at him! He’s making me cry.
DR. ERSKINE
I am searching for qualities beyond
the physical.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Do you know how long it took to set
up this project? The groveling I
had to do in front of Senator
Brandt’s committee?
DR. ERSKINE
I’m well aware of your effortsHodge powers through his push-ups.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Hodge passed every test we gave
him. He’s big, he’s fast, and he
takes orders. In short, he’s a
soldier.
DR. ERSKINE
He’s a bully.
Phillips stares at Erskine a long moment. Then he reaches for
the CRATE IN THE TRUCK.

27 CONTINUED: 27

COLONEL PHILLIPS
You don’t win wars with niceness,
Doctor.
(grabbing a GRENADE)
You win them with guts.
HE PULLS THE PIN AND HURLS THE GRENADE.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
GRENADE!
It tumbles in the grass, stopping in front of the recruits.
Steve’s eyes go wide.
The rest of the recruits scramble away. HODGE YELPS. HE
THROWS HIMSELF UNDERNEATH A NEARBY JEEP.
PEGGY MAKES FOR THE GRENADE, BUT STEVE GETS THERE FIRST,
THROWING HIMSELF ON IT.
STEVE
Everybody DOWN!
Steve waits for the explosion...BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. After a
moment, he opens his eyes, confused.
At the truck, Phillips just glares.
PAN TO THE CRATE, WHICH WE SEE IS CLEARLY LABELED: "M-56
TRAINING GRENADES - INERT."
Erskine smiles at Phillips.
Hodge peaks out from under the jeep, SHAMED.
WIDE ON: STEVE, still splayed over the inert grenade.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Uh...is this a test?
28 INT. CAMP LEHIGH, BARRACKS - NIGHT 28
Steve sits alone on his bunk. Around him, eleven other bunks
lie stripped, their footlockers empty.
DR. ERSKINE enters, carrying a bottle of Schnapps.
DR. ERSKINE
Can’t sleep?
STEVE
Got the jitters, I guess.

Erskine indicates his bottle.
DR. ERSKINE
Me, too.
STEVE
Can I ask you a question?
DR. ERSKINE
Just one?
STEVE
Why me?
Erskine considers this. Then he sighs and pulls up a chair.
DR. ERSKINE
I suppose that is the only question
that matters.
He motions for Steve to grab a couple of water glasses. He
holds up the bottle.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
Made in Augsburg. My city. So many
forget that the first country the
Nazis invaded was their own.
(off Steve’s look)
I don’t excuse what my people have
become. After the first war, my
people struggled...they felt weak,
small. Then Hitler comes with big
show, the marching. He finds me.
Hears of my work. You, he says,
will make us strong.
29 INT. RESEARCH LAB, BERLIN 1938 - FLASHBACK 29
FLASH: A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER ERSKINE WORKS IN A BERLIN LAB, WITH
JOHANN SCHMIDT, WHO WEARS A NAZI ARMBAND.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
I am not interested. He sends the
head of Hydra, his research
division. A brilliant scientist
named Johann Schmidt. Schmidt was a
member of the inner circle,
ambitious, obsessed with occult
power and Teutonic myth. He and
Hitler shared a passion for
violence and Wagner.
26.
28 CONTINUED: 28
29A INT. CAMP LEHIGH, BARRACKS - NIGHT 29A
Erskine sees Steve’s black look. Wagner?
DR. ERSKINE
German operas about war and heroes.
Blood and race. Gods afoot upon the
earth.
(shaking his head)
Me, I like a little Benny Goodman.
ALT. Me, I like jazz.
Steve smiles. Erskine goes on.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
Hitler uses these fantasies to
inspire his followers. But Schmidt
...he does not believe in fantasy.
For him, it is real.
29B INT. RESEARCH LAB, BERLIN 1938 - FLASHBACK 29B
FLASH: SCHMIDT PERUSES AN ANCIENT TOME
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
He became convinced that a great
power had been hidden on earth left
here by the gods - waiting to be
seized by a superior man.
FLASH: HE TALKS TO ERSKINE, WHO SHAKES HIS HEAD.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
And when he understood what my
formula could do, Schmidt could not
resist...
FLASH: SCHMIDT, NOW IN A FULL NAZI UNIFORM, PRESSES A LUGER
BETWEEN ERSKINE’S EYES.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
He had to become that superior man.
30 INT. CAMP LEHIGH, BARRACKS - NIGHT 30
Erskine goes silent. He just stares at his hands.
STEVE
Did it make him strong?
27.

DR. ERSKINE
Yes, but there were
other...effects.
31 INT. RESEARCH LAB, BERLIN 1938 - FLASHBACK 31
FLASH: SCHMIDT LIES ON AN EXAM TABLE, SLEEVES ROLLED UP.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
The serum was not ready, but more
important, the man...
FLASH: ANOTHER NAZI POINTS A GUN. ERSKINE HESITATES. SCHMIDT
YANKS THE NEEDLE FROM HIM AND INJECTS HIMSELF.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
The serum amplifies what is inside.
FLASH: SCHMIDT’S EYES BULGE.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
Good becomes great...
FLASH: HIS SKIN BURNS. HE SCREAMS.
DR. ERSKINE (V.O.)
Bad becomes worse.
32 OMITTED 32
33 INT. CAMP LEHIGH, BARRACKS - NIGHT 33
Erskine pours schnapps into the two glasses Steve holds.
DR. ERSKINE
This is why you were chosen. A
strong man, he might lose respect
for the power if he has had it all
his life. But a weak man knows the
value of strength...and compassion.
STEVE
Thanks. I think.
Erskine chuckles and puts his glasses on.
DR. ERSKINE
Whatever happens tomorrow, promise
me you’ll stay who you are. Not a
perfect soldier...

But a good man.
Steve clinks his glass with Erskine’s.
STEVE
To the little guys.
They move to drink, but Erskine remembers something and grabs
Steve’s glass before he can take a sip.
DR. ERSKINE
What am I doing, you have a
procedure tomorrow. No fluids.
STEVE
We’ll drink it after.
He pours Steve’s drink into his.
DR. ERSKINE
I don’t have procedure tomorrow.
(taking a sip)
Is very good. I save you a little.
34 EXT. HYDRA HQ - DAY 34
WE HEAR THE OVERTURE FROM WAGNER’S "DAS REINGOLD."
PAN DOWN THE CLIFFSIDE TO A BIG BAY WINDOW IN THE ROCK.
Through the glass, we see AN ARTIST PAINTING AT AN EASEL.
We hear knocking.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA (O.S.)
Sir?

JOHANN SCHMIDT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Is it something in particular?
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
I understand you’ve found him.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (O.S.)
See for yourself.
On the table, Zola finds...SURVEILLNACE SHOTS OF ERSKINE IN
NEW YORK: in a cab, buying a hot dog, being escorted by MP’s.
Zola looks up at...Johann Schmidt standing silhouetted in
front of the window. We can’t make out his face.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
You disapprove.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
Berlin doesn’t feel this is a
proper use of their resources.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
And you are now their loyal
servant?
(beat)
Berlin, if they care, can discuss
it with me personally.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
I just don’t see why you need
concern yourself. I can’t imagine
he’ll succeed-
(catching himself)
Again.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
His serum is the Allies’ only
defense against the power we now
possess. If we take it away, our
victory is assured.
Zola nods, resigned.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
Shall I give the order?
JOHANN SCHMIDT
It’s already been given.
Zola smiles tightly and heads for the door. Then...

JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Dr. Zola? What do you think?
Zola glances at the artist, who looks queasy and frightened.
Zola peaks at the painting (which we do not see).

A masterpiece.
36 EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY 36
Kids scramble out of the street as A BLACK SEDAN PASSES.
37 INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY 37
Steve rides with Peggy, staring out at the familiar streets.
STEVE
I know this neighborhood. I got
beat up in that alley...and that
vacant lot...and behind that diner.
PEGGY CARTER
Did you have something against
running away?
STEVE
You start running, they’ll never
let you stop. You stand up, you
push back...they can only tell you
"no" for so long, right?
PEGGY CARTER
I know a bit what that’s like. To
have every door shut in your face.
STEVE
Who’d shut a door on you? I figure
guys would be climbing over each
other to hold them open.
PEGGY CARTER
Depends which door you’re trying to
go through.
STEVE
I guess I don’t know why a
beautiful...agent...why would she
want to join the army anyhow? She
could do whatever she wanted.

PEGGY CARTER
You don’t know an awful lot about
women, do you?
STEVE
(seemingly smooth)
You got me all wrong, Agent Carter.
I don’t know anything about women.
(beat)
This is probably the longest
conversation I’ve ever had with
one.
She is laughing just the teeniest bit.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I wish I were kidding. Think about
it; I don’t have any money, so I
can’t take them to dinner. I’m...
kinda short. That doesn’t help.
Ever. And I don’t dance, so that’s
off the table.
PEGGY CARTER
You must have at least danced.
STEVE
Standing on my mom’s feet when I
was seven. I don’t know. Asking a
girl to dance seemed so terrifying,
and then in the last few years it
didn’t seem so important. I figure
I might as well wait.
PEGGY CARTER
For what?
He shrugs, looking out the window.
STEVE
The right partner.
He doesn’t see that this affects her. The car slows.
PEGGY CARTER
This is it.
38 EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY 38
The sedan pulls up to an ANTIQUE STORE. TWO BUMS LOLL NEAR

ANTIQUE STORE OWNER
Lovely weather this morning, isn’t

ANTIQUE STORE OWNER
I suppose you can’t be too careful.
PEGGY CARTER
Best to be prepared for a shift in

Steve steps out onto a raised platform and gapes: THE HUGE,
ULTRA-MODERN REBIRTH LAB STRETCHES BENEATH THEM, FAR LARGER
THAN THE STORE OUTSIDE. TECHS OPERATE MACHINERY. ENGINEERS
MAN MONITORS. A FILM CREW SETS UP. They all look respectfully
at Steve.
His eyes alight on...THE REBIRTH DEVICE. GLITTERING LENSES
SURROUND A MAN-SHAPED CRADLE. PNEUMATIC PANELS FOLD BELOW.
SIX VITA-RAY REACTORS LOOM BEHIND.
Dr. Erskine scurries about in the center of all prepping.
Steve takes it all in, looking over to an OBSERVATION BOOTH
where a group of men gather.
42 INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - DAY 42
SENATOR BRANDT confers with his aides. A man with glasses
waits a little behind. Phillips enters.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Senator Brandt. Glad you could make
it.
SENATOR BRANDT
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?
Phillips looks down to the machine below.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
We needed access to the city’s
power grid. Of course, if you’d
given us the generator I
requisitioned...
SENATOR BRANDT
Lot of people asking for funds,
Colonel.
(remembering)
Oh, this is Clem...
The man sticks his hand out as Brandt fumbles the name.

HEINZ KRUGER

Phillips nods, as Brandt peers through the window a the lab.
He spots Steve.
SENATOR BRANDT
Jeez, somebody get that kid a
sandwich.
43 INT. REBIRTH LAB - DAY 43
Erskine helps Steve onto the device.
DR. ERSKINE
Comfortable?
STEVE LOOKS SMALL IN THE OUTLINE OF A MUCH LARGER MAN.
STEVE
You save me any of that schnapps?
DR. ERSKINE
(wincing)
Not as much as I should have.
Erskine nods to the attendants, who hook up Steve. He then
looks to A MAN IN A SUIT making adjustments.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
How are your levels, Mr. Stark?
The man steps out from behind the device. Steve blinks,
surprised: IT’S HOWARD STARK.
HOWARD STARK
Coils are at peak, levels are 100%.
We may dim half the lights in
Brooklyn, but we’re ready. As we’ll
ever be.
Steve eyes him warily.

Technically.
He pats Steve on the shoulder. Steve isn’t reassured.
Erskine jostles a nervous Peggy as he tries to squeeze past.
DR. ERSKINE
Agent Carter, wouldn’t you be more
comfortable in the booth?
She gets the hint. She smiles at Steve. Steve smiles back.
Erskine pulls down an overhead microphone. He looks to the
booth, waiting until Phillips is standing near a speaker. He
taps hard on the mic. Phillips winces, holding his ear.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
Ladies and gentlemen, this morning
we do not take another step toward
annihilation. Today, we take the
first step on the path to peace.
44 INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - DAY 44
Brandt watches, skeptical.

She taps the needle, pulls back the plunger...AND INJECTS
STEVE IN THE ARM. He winces...then relaxes.
STEVE
That wasn’t so bad.
DR. ERSKINE
That was a tetanus shot.
A PANEL SLIDES BACK, REVEALING A CAROUSEL OF BLUE VIALS.
SEVEN TUBES OF SERUM STAND AT THE READY.
Erskine and the nurse insert SIX VIALS into THE INJECTORS.
Erskine NODS AT A TECH, WHO DEPLOYS THE INJECTION PADS. THEY
BRISTLE WITH HUNDREDS OF TINY NEEDLETIPS.
They close over Steve, pressing him to the table.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
Beginning serum infusion in five,
four, three, two...one.
He presses a switch. THE INJECTION PADS CLICK. STEVE JERKS AS
UNSEEN NEEDLES DEPLOY. The blue fluid slowly empties from the
serum injectors. Steve’s veins swell. His head begins to
shake.
Erskine hits another button. Padded restraints close in on
Steve’s head, holding him still. Steve’s wide eyes glow an
intense blue. Finally, the injector vials empty completely.
DR. ERSKINE (CONT’D)
Now, Mr. Stark.
STARK PULLS A LEVER. THE TABLE SLOWLY TILTS UPRIGHT. STEVE
RISES LIKE A ROCKET READY TO LAUNCH.
THE PANELS UNFOLD. A HOOD LOWERS OVER STEVE’S HEAD, SEALING
HIM INSIDE THE VITA CHAMBER. A WINDOW FRAMES STEVE’S FACE.
Erskine talks into a mic.

Finally, Stark turns the power dial.
A PIERCING WHINE FILLS THE ROOM. ON A HUGE GAUGE, THE NEEDLE
BEGINS TO CLIMB.

LIGHT BUILDS IN INTENSITY. Technicians pull on goggles. Peggy

Erskine checks Steve’s vitals. He nods to Stark, who turns

70, 80...THE GLOW SURGES, FLOODING THE WINDOW, HIDING STEVE.
The EKG shrieks.

Steven? STEVEN?
Peggy rushes out of the booth and down the stairs.
PEGGY CARTER
Shut it down!
The lights get brighter. The viewers shield their eyes.

STARK GIVES THE DIAL A FINAL TURN. 100. THE WHINE SPLITS THE
AIR. THE VITA RAY CHAMBER FLASHES FROM ORANGE...TO WHITE.
AND THEN IT ALL GOES DARK. THE WHINE DIES. AS DOES THE EKG.
Erskine goes ashen. Stark stares at his and on the dial.
Peggy swallows. Even Phillips looks saddened. And then...A
SOUND RISES: THE STEADY BEEP OF THE EKG. THE LIGHTS RISE.
Erskine hurries to the device.
DR. ERSKINE
Mr. Stark!
Stark hits a button. The hood and panels retract, releasing a
blast of steam. When it clears, Erskine can see...
A NEW MAN HANGING IN THE STRAPS. MUSCULAR, TALL, PERFECT. HIS
HEAD RESTS AGAINST HIS CHEST, EYES CLOSED.
46 INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - DAY 46

leveled, Peggy advances down the street. KRUGER aims the cab
at PEGGY. SHE stands her ground, squeezing off shots. THE
TAXI keeps coming.
Just then, STEVE LEAPS through the FLAMING WRECKAGE and
TACKLES Peggy out of the way. The cab fishtails around the
bend. Peggy shoves at Steve.
PEGGY CARTER
I HAD HIM!

STEVE gets up, BUT falls again, HIS NEW BODY big and awkward.
Furious, he takes off after the cab.
59 INT. TAXICAB - DAY 59
Kruger skids around a corner. The SERUM rolls wildly on the
seat. He snatches it up and sticks it in his front pocket.
60 EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY 60
Peggy stops A SEDAN. A man rolls down the window.
DRIVER
Stay out of the road, there’s someHEY!
She yanks him out and gets behind the wheel, peeling out.

streets.
A HORN blares. KRUGER looks to see a TRUCK ROARING at him.
Steve sees the same thing. Kruger yanks the wheel. THE TRUCK
SIDESWIPES the TAXI, THROWING it into a ROLL. KIDS look over
from their BALL GAME to see...
STEVE atop the TUMBLING CAB, riding it like a rolling LOG.
THE CAR CRASHES TO A STOP.
68 EXT. RIVERSIDE DOCKS - DAY 68
Steve struggles to his feet. A BLOODIED KRUGER stumbles out
of the wreck, firing.
ACROSS THE WAY, TOURISTS wait in line for the STATUE OF
LIBERTY FERRY. THEY gape.
A bullet kicks the concrete at Steve’s feet. HE picks up the
TORN-OFF TAXI DOOR, holding it like a SHIELD. ONE TOURIST
SNAPS A PHOTO. Kruger fires at Steve the bullets ripping
through shield door. SHRAPNEL tears at STEVE but he just
keeps coming. Finally, KRUGER TURNS AND RUNS.
69 EXT. PIER PARKING LOT - DAY 69
Kruger shoves through THE PACK OF WAITING TOURISTS.
STRIPED SHIRT KID
Hey, watch it, mister!
KRUGER grabs the smallest BOY, putting a GUN to his TEMPLE.

70 EXT. BROOKLYN PIER - DAY 70
Kruger drags the kid to the water. Steve follows, relentless.
Kruger points the gun at Steve. CLICK. Empty. KRUGER hurls
the KID in the drink. Steve races to save him.

Kruger presses his lighter again. A ONE-MAN SUBMARINE
SURFACES. HE SCRAMBLES down to it. Steve spots THE KID,
GRIPPING THE LADDER.
STRIPED SHIRT KID

Steve hangs on tight. HE PUNCHES THE COCKPIT GLASS, AGAIN AND
AGAIN. STEVE PUNCHES ONE LAST TIME. THE GLASS SPIDERWEBS
AROUND HIS FIST. KRUGER RAGES AS WATER POURS IN.
Steve tugs on the latch, OPENING THE COCKPIT. He pulls Kruger
out and kicks for the surface. The sub plows into the silty
riverbottom.

Steve throws Kruger to the dock. KRUGER WHIRLS AROUND WITH A
KNIFE. STEVE KICKS HIM. The knife and THE SERUM go flying.

HEINZ KRUGER (CONT’D)

Steve’s eyes go wide as Kruger SEIZES UP AND DIES. STEVE
LOOKS DOWN AT HIMSELF, STUNNED AT HIS NEW BODY. He stands
alone on the pier, A MAN TRANSFORMED. JUST THEN, PEGGY
SQUEALS UP IN THE SEDAN. She jumps out and runs to Steve.
More jeeps full of MP’s screech in.
75 INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 75
THREE NAZI OFFICERS, ROEDER, SCHNEIDER and HUTTER eye A HYDRA
BANNER with distaste as they stalk after...Schmidt, who never
stops walking.
ROEDER
The Fuhrer feels your continued
disregard of military protocol is
unacceptable.
They pass imposing HYDRA TROOPERS posted along the hall.
SCHNEIDER
You serve at his pleasure. He gave
you this facility as a reward for
your...injuries.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Reward? You may call it what it
really is - an exile. I no longer
reflect his image of Aryan
perfection.
ROEDER
You think this is about
appearances? Your Hydra division
has failed to deliver so much as a
rifle in over a year. We had to
learn through local intelligence
you had mounted a full-scale
incursion into Norway.
46.
74 CONTINUED: 74

SCHNIEDER
The Fuhrer feels - how does he put
it? - The Red Skull has been
indulged long enough.
SCHMIDT FINALLY STOPS, TURNS AND GLARES AT SCHNEIDER.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
You came to see the results of our
work. Come. Let me show you.
He leads them to a door marked, "ANGEWANDTE IDEE MECHANIK."
TWO MASSIVE GUARDS stand on either side.
76 INT. HYDRA HQ, SCHMIDT’S OFFICE LAB - CONTINUOUS 76
Schmidt leads them inside, where...ZOLA AND SEVERAL TECHS
WORK ON A BLUE CUBE GENERATOR AMIDST COMPLICATED MACHINERY.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Hitler speaks of a thousand year
Reich. Yet he cannot feed his
armies for a month. His troops
spill blood by the gallon across
every field in Europe. Yet he gets
no closer to achieving his goals.
ROEDER
And I suppose you still aim to win
this war through magic?
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Science. Though I understand your
confusion. Great power has always
baffled primitive men.
He gestures to the complicated machinery.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Hydra has perfected a weapon which
can destroy my enemies in one
swift, brutal stroke. Wherever they
are, no matter how many forces they
possess. All in a matter of hours.
ROEDER
Your enemies?
Schmidt indicates A MAP MARKED WITH RED PINS.

75 CONTINUED: 75

JOHANN SCHMIDT
I now wield enough destructive
force to decimate every hostile
capital on earth. Simultaneously.
Quite simply, gentlemen...I have
harnessed the power of the gods.
The Nazis eye each other.
SCHNEIDER
Thank you, Schmidt.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
For what?
SCHNEIDER
For making it clear how obviously
mad you are.
Hutter studies the map.
HUTTER
Berlin in on this map!
Schmidt looks calmly from one Nazi to the other.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
So it is.
SCHMIDT PUSHES A SWITCH. A CANNON RISES FROM THE APPARATUS.
ITS CHAMBER GLOWS A FAMILIAR BLUE.
HUTTER
(unaware)
You will be punished for your
insolence!
THE DEVICE ROTATES TOWARD THE OFFICERS, CALIBRATING.
HUTTER (CONT’D)
You will be brought before the
Fuhrer himselfTHE CANNON BLOWS HUTTER TO MIST. The other Nazis scramble.
Schneider jumps away as the cannon fires. It misses. Schmidt
frowns. He starts to pull his Luger...then Schneider trips.
The cannon aims again. BLAM. Roeder backs up toward the wall.
ROEDER
Schmidt!
BLAM. Schmidt gazes down at the dead Nazis, impassive. He
turns to Zola and the Hydra techs, who stare, shocked.

Hitler’s shadow.

Zola carefully considers the moment. Finally, he relents,
offering a measured Hydra salute.

THROUGH A WINDOW, WE SEE...Howard Stark, in coveralls and
goggles, slowly taking apart the HYDRA MINISUB.
PULL BACK: Steve stares down at him as AN SSR DOCTOR AND
NURSE draw blood from his arm. Peggy watches with concern.
STEVE
You think you’ve got enough?
The nurse fills the vial, resting it beside A DOZEN OTHERS.
PEGGY CARTER
All of Dr. Erskine’s research and
equipment is gone. Any hope of
reproducing the program is locked
in your genetic code. But it would
take years.

At the moment, you’re the only
super soldier there is.
Steve rolls down his sleeve. On the desk he sees...ERSKINE’S
SHATTERED GLASSES.
STEVE
Erskine deserved more than that.

78 INT. SSR WAREHOUSE - DAY 78
Stark works as Phillips enters, Brandt and his aids on his
heels
SENATOR BRANDT
Colonel Phillips, my committee is
demanding answers.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Great. Why don’t we start with how
a German spy got a ride to my
secret installation in your car?
Brandt frowns, shuts up. Phillips turns to Stark as Steve and
Peggy join them.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
What’ve we got?
HOWARD STARK
Well, speaking modestly, I’d say
I’m the best mechanical engineer in
the country...
Stark opens A HATCH. IMPRESSIVE CIRCUITRY blinks inside.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
And I’ve got no idea what any of
this is or how it works. We’re
nowhere near capable of this
technology.
SENATOR BRANDT
Then who is?
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Hydra.
Brandt looks at him blankly.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
I’m sure you’ve read our briefings.

77 CONTINUED: 77

SENATOR BRANDT
I’m on a number of committees,
Colonel.
PEGGY CARTER
Hydra is the Nazi deep science
division. It’s led by Dr. Erskine’s
first test subject, Johann Schmidt.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Hydra’s practically a cult. They
worship Schmidt, think he’s
invincible.
SENATOR BRANDT
So what are you going to do about
it?
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I spoke to the President this
morning. As of today, the SSR’s
being re-tasked.
PEGGY CARTER
(surprised)
Colonel?
COLONEL PHILLIPS
We’re taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent. You, too,
Stark. The three of us fly to
London tonight.
STEVE
Sir? If you’re going after Schmidt,
I want in.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
You’re an experiment. We’re sending
you to Alamogordo.
STEVE
As what, a lab rat? The serum
worked!
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I asked for an army. All I got is
you. And you are not enough.
Steve looks sunk. Brandt waves his aide over.

78 CONTINUED: 78

SENATOR BRANDT
With all due respect, Colonel, I
think we may be missing the point.
You’ve seen Steve here in action.
More importantly, the country’s
seen it.
Brandt’s aide hands over A COPY OF THE NEW YORK EXAMINER:
"NAZI SABOTEUR FOILED! MYSTERY MAN SAVES CIVILIANS!"
In the photo, STEVE DEFLECTS GUNFIRE WITH A STARRED CAR DOOR.
SENATOR BRANDT (CONT’D)
Enlistment lines have been around
the block since this hit the
newsstands. You don’t take a
soldier, a symbol, like this and
hide him in a lab.
Steve looks surprised. He didn’t expect Brandt to step up for
him.
Brandt turns on the charm, becoming the consummate
politician.
SENATOR BRANDT (CONT’D)
He needs to be out there, showing
the world what the American
fighting man is made of.
(to Steve)
Son, do you want to serve your
country? On the most important
battlefield in this war?
STEVE
It’s all I want.
SENATOR BRANDT
Then congratulations. You just got
promoted.
Off Steve’s smile...
79 INT. SMALL THEATER, BACKSTAGE - DAY 79

Steve swallows hard.
STEVE
Not how I pictured getting there.
BRANDT’S AIDE
The Senator’s got a lot of pull on
the Hill. Play ball with us and

Steve considers this as A BUGLE PLAYS...

STEVEN STUMBLES THROUGH THE CURTAINS, AS IF SHOVED. HE WEARS
RED BOOTS AND GLOVES, A BLUE COSTUME WITH A STARS-AND-STRIPES
SHIRT AND A MASK WITH WINGS. DANCING GIRLS in short skirts
look expectant. Steve stares at the small audience, dismayed.
In the crowd, SENATOR BRANDT LOOKS PLEASED. Steve glances
over his shoulder. Brandt’s aide gives him the thumbs up. The
girls sing, introducing our hero...
DANCING GIRLS
Who’s strong and brave, here to
save the American way?
Steve checks the CUE CARD taped inside his TRIANGULAR SHIELD.
STEVE

COLONEL PHILLIPS
Yeah. It’s called "winning the

STEVE
But if you know where they areCOLONEL PHILLIPS
They’re thirty miles behind the
lines. Through some of the most

Europe. We’d lose more men than
we’d save. I don’t expect you to

Then understand it somewhere else.
If I read the posters right, you’ve

Howard executes evasive maneuvers. STEVE straps on his
PARACHUTE AND throws open the JUMP DOOR.
PEGGY CARTER
Rogers, get back here. We’re taking
you all the way in!
EXPLOSIONS ROCK THE AIR. STEVE HESITATES. REALIZING WHAT HE’S
ABOUT TO DO. BAM! HE TURNS TO PEGGY.
STEVE
ONCE I’M CLEAR, TURN THIS THING
AROUND AND GET OUT OF HERE!
PEGGY CARTER
YOU CAN’T GIVE ME ORDERS!
STEVE
THE HELL I CAN’T!
(bracing in the doorway)
I’M A CAPTAIN!
BAM! The plane lurches once more just as...STEVE JUMPS.
103 OMITTED 103
104 INT. LOCKHEED ELECTRA - NIGHT 104
Peggy catches a glimpse of Steve’s chute. She swears under

106 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY - NIGHT 106
SEARCHLIGHTS SWEEP FROM WATCHTOWERS. A BARBED-WIRE FENCE
RINGS A COMPOUND OF BUILDINGS. A FACTORY BELCHES SMOKE.
107 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, FLOOR - NIGHT 107
A Hydra tech loads BLUE CARTRIDGES into a CLUSTERBOMB, then
gently loads the clusterbomb into a nose cone.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
As you see, production is
proceeding faultlessly.
ZOLA and SCHMIDT walk the factory floor. CATWALKS RADIATE
FROM A CONTROL ROOM OVERHEAD.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA (CONT’D)
Even in ordnance of this size.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Good. Increase output by sixty
percent. See to it our other
facilities do the same.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
But our...workers. I am not sure
they have the strength.
P.O.W.’S LABOR AT GUNPOINT. A GIANT CRANE LOADS BOMBS ONTO A
RAIL CAR.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Then use what strength they have
left, Doctor. There are always more
workers.
108 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, MAIN GATE - NIGHT 108
Steve peers out at THE GUARDS PATROLLING THE MAIN GATE. He
DROPS as headlights sweep the road. THREE COVERED TRUCKS
rumble toward the gate. A GATE GUARD checks the drivers’
papers. In the background, we spy...STEVE SNEAKING INTO THE
LAST TRUCK.
109 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, COMPOUND - NIGHT 109
The trucks roll into the compound, gates closing behind them.
GUARDS hurry out to unload the trucks.
65.
(CONTINUED)
AT THE LAST TRUCK, ONE GUARD peers in, curious: A RED, WHITE
AND BLUE SHIELD stands amongst the supplies. WHAM! THE SHIELD
SPRINGS OUT, SMASHING HIM IN THE FACE. The guard drops. Steve
emerges from the darkness.
110 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, COMPOUND - NIGHT 110
HYDRA GUARDS PROD P.O.W.’S ACROSS THE COMPOUND. Steve
follows, keeping to the shadows. AT THE BARRACKS, one guard
stands watch as the other leads the prisoners inside...
111 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, BARRACKS - NIGHT 111
A WARDER opens A CAGE and prods the prisoner in. A PRISONER
IN A HAT bring up the rear, slow. THE WARDER hits him with a
truncheon, knocking off his bowler. The prisoner picks up his
hat and puts it back on. WE NOW SEE IT’S DUM DUM DUGAN. He
stares at the Warder.
DUM DUM DUGAN
You know, Fritz, one of these days,
I’m gonna get my own stick.
The warder viciously kicks Dugan inside. Down the row, a
hundred more prisoners are trapped in a dozen more cages.
112 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, COMPOUND - NIGHT 112
The guard steps out to find HIS PARTNER SLEEPING AGAINST THE
WALL, HELMET OVER HIS EYES. He kicks him, but the guard
doesn’t move. He lifts his partner’s helmet to see...HE’S OUT
COLD.
STEVE steps up behind him with a TRUNCHEON. CRACK!
113 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, BARRACKS - NIGHT 113
Four prisoners, FALSWORTH, JONES, DERNIER and DUGAN slump on
the floor of their cage, exhausted. The WARDER on the upper
floor makes his rounds. He passes out of sight. Then...WHACK!
THE WARDER DROPS on top of the cage, UNCONSCIOUS. The
prisoners jump up as...STEVE LOOKS DOWN AT THEM.
STEVE
Hi.
The prisoners stare, stunned. Jones raises an eyebrow at
Steve’s outfit and shield.
66.
109 CONTINUED: 109

JONES
And who the hell are you supposed
to be?
STEVE
I’m...Captain America.
The prisoners’ excitement dies.
DERNIER
Merde.
TIME CUT:
114 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, BARRACKS - NIGHT 114
Freed prisoners follow Steve as he makes his way down the
row, opening cages with THE GUARD’S KEYS. He releases
FALSWORTH, JONES, DERNIER and DUGAN. Dugan spots A JAPANESEAMERICAN SOLDIER, MORITA, already free.
DUM DUM DUGAN
What, are we taking everybody?
MORITA
I’m from Fresno, Ace.
Steve searches the throng of prisoners.
STEVE
Are there any others?
FALSWORTH
They did take a number of the men
to isolation ward. I’m afraid we
haven’t seen them since.
Steve considers this as the prisoners gather round. Finally,
he hands them a pistol and grenades.
STEVE
The tree line’s northwest, about 80
yards from the gate. From there,
just follow the creek bed.
(turning to leave)
I’ll meet you in the clearing with
anybody I find inside.
Jones stops him.
67.
113 CONTINUED: 113

JONES
Wait. You sure you know what you’re
doing?
STEVE
Sure. I’ve knocked out Adolph
Hitler over 200 times.
Steve moves out.
115 OMITTED 115
116 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY - NIGHT 116
Steve circles the factory, looking for a way in.
117 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, FLOOR - NIGHT 117
A HYDRA GUARD stands watch near a door. He hears...TAPPING. A
SILHOUETTE appears behind the glass. The guard cautiously
opens the door and pokes his head out.
HYDRA GUARD
Ja?
The door SLAMS, PINNING HIS HEAD. The guard looks up to see
Steve’s fist coming right at him. WHAM!
Steve enters the factory, creeping between bombs and crates.
Clusters of cartridges bristle inside an unfinished bomb.
STEVE pulls one out, curious, IT GLOWS BLUE IN HIS HAND. He
pockets the cartridge and heads fro the STAIRS.
118 EXT. HALF-TRACK - NIGHT 118
DUGAN SLAMS A HYDRA GUARD INTO THE GRILL OF A HALF-TRACK.
DERNIER AND FALSWORTH CLIMB UP TOP. Dernier settles behind
the complicated-looking weapon.
FALSWORTH
Are you quite sure you know how to
use that?
Dernier peers at the grip. BLAM! THE CANNON DISCHARGES,
BLOWING A SMOKING HOLE IN THE FACTORY WALL.
DERNIER
Oui.
68.
114 CONTINUED: 114
119 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 119
ON A MONITOR, THE FACTORY WALL BURNS. Schmidt scans his
security cameras. He presses a button, SOUNDING THE ALARM
OUTSIDE. At the controls behind him, Zola looks worried.
120 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, STAIRS - NIGHT 120
A GUARD rushes down the stairs, his jackboots almost
crushing...STEVE’S FINGERS. STEVE HANGS UNDER THE STAIRCASE.
Steve yanks the guard’s ankle. HE TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS.
121 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CATWALK - NIGHT 121
Steve steps onto A CATWALK, only to be met by ANOTHER GUARD
pointing a pistol. Steve knocks the gun from his hand and
smashes him in the face. The guard falls, FLIPS BACK UP and
charges. Steve swings from a beam and...KICKS THE GUARD IN
THE CHEST.
122 INT. HALF-TRACK - NIGHT 122
Dugan stares at the GERMAN CONTROLS, baffled. Just then,
Jones slides into the passenger seat.
DUM DUM DUGAN
Not exactly a Buick.
JONES
That one. Zündung.
DUM DUM DUGAN
You speak German?
JONES
Natürlich, natürlich spreche ich
Deutsch.
(off Dugan’s look)
Three semesters at Howard. Then I
switched to French. Cuter girls.
Dugan pushes ZüNDUNG. THE HALF-TRACK ROARS TO LIFE.
DUM DUM DUGAN
I didn’t ask for a resume.
69.
123 EXT. HALF-TRACK - NIGHT 123
FALSWORTH AND DERNIER HANG ON AS THE HALF-TRACK LURCHES
FORWARD.
124 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CATWALK - NIGHT 124
Steve looks over the factory floor, taking in the full scale
of the bomb-making facility. Just then...TWO MORE SOLDIERS
ATTACK FROM EITHER SIDE. The first guard fires. Steve drops
and shoots him down. The second guard closes in. Steve whirls
and crushes his neck with the side of his shield.
125 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 125
Schmidt surveys the uprising on his monitors. OUTSIDE, the
guards struggle to fend off escaping P.O.W.’S. INSIDE, a
strangely-clad soldier takes on THREE GUARDS.
Schmidt adjusts his screen: STEVE HITS ONE GUARD, KICKS
ANOTHER, THEN USES HIM TO DEFLECT THE BLAST OF A THIRD. MOVE
IN ON SCHMIDT’S FACE AS HE STUDIES STEVE, IMPRESSED.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Doctor, prepare to evacuate.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
I’m sure our forces can handleSchmidt eyes Steve on the monitor. Steve dispatches the last
guard and HEADS UP THE STAIRS.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Our forces are outmatched.
Schmidt presses a button. ALARMS NOW BLARE INSIDE THE
FACTORY.
ZOLA HURRIES OUT OF THE ROOM. Schmidt flicks the switches on
a line of timers: SELBSTZERSTöRUNG. Each of them starts A
COUNTDOWN. Then he turns. THE CUBE PULSES IN A CRADLE BEHIND
SMOKED GLASS. He lowers A TITANIUM CASE over the cradle. It
retracts the cube...PLUNGING the interior of the FACTORY INTO
DARKNESS.
126 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, COMPOUND - NIGHT 126
HYDRA GUARDS FILL THE COMPOUND, TAKING ON P.O.W.’S. MORITA
THROWS A GRENADE, BLOWING THE GUARDS AWAY.
70.
127 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, ZOLA’S EXPERIMENT ROOM - NIGHT 127
Zola rifles through a filing cabinet in the corner of a tiled
room. He gathers A SHEAF OF DOCUMENTS. We glimpse a sketch of
a TV-CHESTED ROBOTIC SUIT. Beyond Zola, A SHADOWY FIGURE LIES
SLUMPED IN A CAGE.
128 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, ZOLA’S EXPERIMENT ROOM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT 128
Steve reaches the corridor. At the far end, ZOLA SCURRIES OUT
OF HIS ROOM, FILES PRESSED TO HIS CHEST. Zola sees Steve.
Steve advances. Zola runs the other way.
129 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, ZOLA’S EXPERIMENT ROOM - NIGHT 129
Steve stalks inside, wary. Past the scattered files and
specimen jars, he sees...THE LARGE CAGE atop a rusty drain. A
PRISONER lies slumped against the bars. On hearing Steve’s
footfalls, he calls out wearily.
PRISONER
Barnes, James Buchanan. Sergeant.
32557038.
Steve gapes, stunned. He can’t believe it.
STEVE
Bucky?
Silence. The prisoner doesn’t respond. Then"
BUCKY
Who...who is that?
Steve races to the cage. We can now clearly see a beaten,
grizzled BUCKY BARNES staring out. Bucky squints, unable to
focus. He seems to have aged 10 years.
BUCKY (CONT’D)
Is that...
STEVE SMASHES OFF THE LOCK. HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND, GRINNING.
STEVE
It’s me, Buck.
Bucky studies his friend’s face.
BUCKY
Steve?
71.
(CONTINUED)
STEVE
I thought you were dead.
BUCKY
I thought you were smaller.
Steve gently helps him down from the cage. Buck gapes at his
transformed, much taller friend.
BUCKY (CONT’D)
What happened to you?
STEVE
I joined the Army.
130 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 130
The first of the timers reaches ZERO. It beeps.
131 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, FLOOR - NIGHT 131
One of the machines on the factory floor EXPLODES!
132 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, ZOLA’S EXPERIMENT ROOM - NIGHT 132
Steve and Bucky stagger as the blast shakes the room. As they
head out, Steve spots A HUGE MAP, featuring a series of HYDRA
SYMBOLS SPREADING ACROSS EUROPE.
133 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CORRIDOR - NIGHT 133
Steve helps Bucky limp down the corridor. More bombs go off.
BUCKY
Did it hurt?
STEVE
Little bit.
BUCKY
Is it permanent?
STEVE
So far.
BUCKY
You are going to get so many girls.
72.
129 CONTINUED: 129
134 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, STAIRS - NIGHT 134
Bucky and Steve reach the stairs. They head down but ANOTHER
EXPLOSION blocks their way. THEY HEAD BACK UP, SPOTTING A
CATWALK HIGH ABOVE.
135 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, COMPOUND - NIGHT 135
Morita leads a group of P.O.W.’s toward the main gate. He
hears something roaring up behind them. He looks.
MORITA
DOWN!
He tackles a P.O.W. To the ground as...ZAP! A BLUE BLAST JUST
CLEARS THEIR HEADS, BLOWING AWAY THE MAIN GATE. Behind THE
CANNON, Dernier and Falsworth whoop, politely. P.O.W.’S SWARM
THE GATE.
136 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, CATWALK - NIGHT 136
Steve and Bucky reach THE CATWALK only to find...SCHMIDT ON
THE OTHER SIDE. Zola waits behind him at THE ELEVATOR.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Captain America. How exciting.
(smiles)
I’m a fan of your films.
Schmidt hands the titanium box to Zola. HE AND STEVE SLOWLY
WALK FORWARD, STUDYING EACH OTHER.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
So the old man managed it after
all. Not quite an improvement, but
impressive.
STEVE HITS SCHMIDT IN THE JAW, SENDING HIM REELING.
STEVE
You’ve go no idea.
Schmidt straightens up...STRANGELY PLEASED.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
Don’t I?
Schmidt swings, but STEVE BLOCKS IT WITH HIS SHIELD.
Schmidt’s fist leaves A DENT in the steel. Steve gapes,
surprised. When he looks up, SCHMIDT HAMMERS HIM. STEVE GOES
DOWN. Schmidt looms over him.
73.
(CONTINUED)
STEVE
(stunned)
Erskine said your experiment was a
failure.
Steve kicks up, driving his feet into Schmidt’s jaw. BAM!
SCHMIDT TUMBLES TO THE FLOOR. Zola scrambles to THE CATWALK
CONTROLS. A GAP APPEARS BETWEEN SCHMIDT AND STEVE AS BOTH
SIDES RETRACT. SCHMIDT SHOOTS A WITHERING LOOK AT ZOLA. Zola
pales. When Schmidt turns back to Steve...HIS FACE IS ASKEW.
RED SKIN BULGES FROM TORN SEAMS.
JOHANN SCHMIDT
A failure? Oh, no, Captain.
He gets to his feet.
JOHANN SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
I was his greatest success.
HE PULLS, PEELING HIS FACE FROM THE BONE, revealing...A RED
SKULL UNDERNEATH. HE GRINS, HIDEOUS. Steve stares in
disbelief.
BUCKY
You don’t have one of those, do
you?
Bucky gapes, then looks at Steve worriedly.
RED SKULL tosses his mask away. JOHANN SCHMIDT’S FACE WAFTS
INTO THE FLAMES, STARING AT US AS IT FALLS.
RED SKULL
You’re a liar, Captain. You pretend
to be a simple soldier. But in
reality you’re just afraid to admit
we’ve left humanity behind.
ANOTHER EXPLOSION ROCKS THE FLOOR BELOW.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.
Without the masquerade...without
fear.
STEVE
Then how come you’re running?
Steve scowls from the end of the catwalk, helpless. Zola
hands Skull back his titanium box. Then the two of them step
into the elevator and disappear. Steve pulls Bucky away as
EXPLOSIONS ROCK THE CATWALK. THEY SPOT A GANTRY ABOVE.
74.
136 CONTINUED: 136
137 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, ROOF - NIGHT 137
Zola eyes Skull’s exposed head, queasy. Finally, he looks
away and notices THE FLOOR INDICATOR.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
Sir? We’re going to the roof?
Skull remains silent. The doors open, revealing...A CATWALK
LEADING TO A WAITING TRIEBFLUGEL...built for one.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA (CONT’D)
But...what about me?
Skull hands Zola...A SET OF CAR KEYS.
RED SKULL
Not a scratch, Doctor.
Skull exits the elevator. Zola stares at the keys as the
doors close.
138 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, TOP GANTRY - NIGHT 138
Steve and Bucky reach the gantry. Bucky runs on. IT CREAKS.
Steve steps on.
STEVE
Hurry.
Carefully, Bucky limps across the gantry. Rivets fall.
139 EXT. HYDRA FACTORY, WOODS - NIGHT 139
Morita leads the injured P.O.W.’s toward the woods. Just
then, SOMETHING ROARS OVERHEAD. He looks up at...THE
TRIEBFLUGEL, its rotating engines whirling into a blur.
140 INT. TRIEBFLUGEL - NIGHT 140
Skull glances out the cockpit. Below, his factory burns. He
can just make out...A CAR speeding down a lonely road.
141 INT. SCHMIDT’S CAR - NIGHT 141
Files slide on the seat as Zola speeds away. His feet barely
reach the pedals.
75.
142 INT. HYDRA FACTORY, TOP GANTRY - NIGHT 142
BUCKY JUMPS FORM THE END OF THE GANTRY TO THE OTHER SIDE.
JUST THEN, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODES. THE GANTRY COLLAPSES. Steve
stands alone, trapped. Bucky looks around, frantic.
BUCKY
There's got to be a rope or
somethingSTEVE
JUST GET OUT!
The explosions come faster now. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BUCKY
Not without you.
THE ROOF AROUND STEVE FALLS IN. He eyes the impossible gap.
STEVE
Aw, hell.
He backs up, THEN RACES FOR THE EDGE. Bucky’s eyes go wide
as...STEVE LEAPS, SAILING OVER THE BLAZING CHAOS. JUST AS the
BIGGEST BOMB YET GOES OFF. KA...BOOM!
143 INT. U.S. CAMP, PHILLIPS’ TENT - DAY 143
Phillips stares out his window, stoic.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Senator Brandt, I regret to report
that Captain Steven G. Rogers went
missing behind enemy lines on the
3rd of last week.
He looks down to read the rough draft on his notepad. We see
that he’s dictating to the corporal.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Aerial reconnaissance has proven
unfruitful. As a result, I must
declare Captain Rogers killed in
action.
The corporal stops typing. Phillips turns to see...PEGGY
standing in the door, red-eyed and tired.
PEGGY CARTER
The last surveillance flight is
back.
76.
(CONTINUED)
She enters and lays down AERIAL PICTURES OF THE DISINTEGRATED
HYDRA CAMP.
PEGGY CARTER (CONT’D)
No sign of activity.
Phillips gazes at the photos. Then he looks to the corporal.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Corporal. Why don’t you go get a
cup of coffee?
The corporal nods and leaves the room.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
I can’t touch Stark. He’s a
civilian...and the Army’s number
one weapons contractor. You’re
neither.
PEGGY CARTER
You’ll have my resignation in the
morning.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I can probably make it so that
you’ll avoid a court martial.
PEGGY CARTER
With respect, sir, I don’t regret
my actions. And I doubt Captain
Rogers did, either.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
What makes you think I give a damn
about your opinions?
Peggy goes cold. Phillips steps forward.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
I took a chance on you, Agent
Carter. Now that boy-and a lot of
other men-are dead, because you had
a crush.
PEGGY CARTER
It wasn’t that.
(quietly)
I had faith.
77.
143 CONTINUED: 143
(CONTINUED)
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Well, I hope that’s a great comfort
to you when they shut this division
down.
A commotion builds outside.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
What the hell’s going on out there?
SOLDIERS RUNNING BY PHILLIPS’ WINDOW. He and Peggy move
closer to look...
144 EXT. U.S. CAMP - DAY 144
Phillips and Peggy step outside to see DOZENS OF SOLDIERS
HURRYING TOWARD THE CAMP ENTRANCE. The soldiers part,
revealing...STEVE AND BUCKY WALKING UP THE ROAD, LEADING A
SQUAD OF P.O.W.’S. RAGTAG VEHICLES FOLLOW, CARRYING THE REST.
Steve’s uniform hangs filthy and torn. His shield is battered
and bent. BUT HIS HEAD IS HIGH. G.I.’s CHEER, more come
running.
Hodge steps out of the barracks, drying his hair. He stops,
STUNNED.
HODGE
Rogers?
Amazed, Phillips looks to Peggy, who wipes away tears. The
stunned crowd parts. Steve salutes Phillips.
STEVE
Colonel, some of these men need
medical attention.
Phillips looks at the gaunt faces of the men. He nods. Medics
rush in to help the P.O.W.’s.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I’d like to surrender myself for
disciplinary action.
PHILLIPS LOOKS AT STEVE’S BATTERED, BURNED SHIELD.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
That won’t be necessary.
STEVE
Sir, I78.
143 CONTINUED: (2) 143
(CONTINUED)
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Just how many orders do you plan on
disobeying, Captain?
Steve and Phillips lock eyes. Steve smiles.
STEVE
Yes, sir.
Phillips turns to Peggy, smiling wryly.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Faith, huh?
He walks away as Steve turns to Peggy. She stops herself from
hugging him.
PEGGY CARTER
You’re late.
He pulls out THE STARK TRANSPONDER. IT’S SHOT TO PIECES.
STEVE
Sorry, couldn’t call my ride.
THEY STARE at each other a long, lingering MOMENT.
THEN...SOLDIERS, including those who BOOED him at the USO
show, crowd around slapping STEVE ON THE BACK. They wave his
COMIC BOOK, yelling for CAPTAIN AMERICA. FLASHBULBS POP.
STEVE SMILES DESPITE HIMSELF, finally accepted. A PRETTY
NURSE approaches BUCKY.
NURSE
Where do you hurt, soldier.
A SLOW SMILE CREEPS ACROSS HIS FACE.
145 EXT. ALLIED HEADQUARTERS - DAY 145
BARRAGE BALLOONS fly high over London.
TILT DOWN TO AN IMPOSING BUILDING. A NEWSSTAND IN FRONT FLOGS
A PAPER: "CAPT. AMERICA TO RECEIVE MEDAL OF HONOR."
TILT DOWN FARTHER, THROUGH THE PAVEMENT TO...
146 INT. ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 146
A BRIEFING ROOM IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER.

STEVE (O.S.)
The fourth one was in Poland, here,
not far from the Baltic...
Peggy watches STEVE SKETCH PRECISE COORDINATES ON A MAP,
perfectly duplicating the one in the Hydra factory.
STEVE (CONT’D)
And the last was outside of
Strasbourg, say thirty, forty miles
west of the Maginot line.
(looking up)
I only go a quick look.
PEGGY CARTER
Nobody’s perfect.
An aid picks up the map and carries it across the room. Steve
and Peggy turn as Howard Stark approaches, a BLUE HYDRA
CARTRIDGE in his hand.
HOWARD STARK
Hey, aren’t you supposed to be
picking up a medal right about now?
STEVE
I’m off the publicity circuit.
Just then, Phillips approaches from across the room.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Rogers, you just embarrassed a
senior senator in front of a dozen
reporters and ten members of
Parliament.
He hands Steve a medal.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
You should get a medal just for
that.
He sees the HYDRA CARTRIDGE.
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
You figure out what this is, yet?
HOWARD STARK
If you believe Rogers, it’s
apparently the most powerful
explosive known to man.
80.
146 CONTINUED: 146
(CONTINUED)
STEVE
If?
HOWARD STARK
Well, either you’re wrong or
Schmidt’s damn near rewritten the
laws of physics.
He moves off toward his lab.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
And I’m rather fond of the laws of
physics...
Phillips moves toward the room-sized map table.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
These are all of Hydra’s factories.
STEVE
The ones we know about. But Sgt.
Barnes said Hydra shipped all the
bombs to another facility. And
that...wasn’t on the map.
PHILLIPS STUDIES THE MAP, DECIDING. Then walks toward his
office.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6.
I want every Allied eyeball looking
for that main Hydra base.
PEGGY CARTER
What about us?
COLONEL PHILLIPS
We’re going to light a fire under
Johann Schmidt’s ass.
(to Steve)
What do you say, Rogers? It’s your
map. Think you can wipe Hydra off
it?
Steve stares, finally given the responsibility he’s wanted.
STEVE
I’m going to need a team.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
We’ve already started lining up the
best men81.

Let me get this straight.
148 INT. THE WHIP & FIDDLE PUB - NIGHT 148
FALSWORTH, JONES, DERNIER, MORITA, AND DUGAN lean on stools.
Steve lines up at a DART BOARD.
JONES
We barely got out of there alive
and you want us to go back?
Steve weighs a DART, then casually tosses a BULLSEYE.
STEVE
Pretty much.
The men look at each other for a long, pregnant moment.
FALSWORTH
Sounds rather a good time,
actually.
MORITA
I’m in.
Steve eyes Dernier, questioning. Dernier nods.
DERNIER
Je combattrai jusqu’a ce que le
dernier de ces batards soit mort,
echaine ou bien qu’il pleure comme
un nouveau-ne!
JONES
(laughing)
"J’espere touts les trois!"
Dernier laughs, clapping Jones on the shoulder. When they
look up, they see the others not understanding a word.
JONES (CONT’D)
Oh, uh, we’re in.
DUM DUM DUGAN finishes a beer, mustache covered in foam.

DUM DUM DUGAN
I’ll fight. Well, I’ll always
fight. But you gotta do one thing
for me.
STEVE
What’s that?
He hands over his EMPTY PINT GLASS.
DUM DUM DUGAN
Open a tab.
The others LAUGH and hand Steve theirs. Steve grins and takes
the glasses back to the bar where...BUCKY WAITS.
Steve slides over the empties.
STEVE
Another round?
THE BARTENDER looks impressed.
BARTENDER
You drink all these yourself?
ALT. Where are they putting all
this?
ALT. It is possible to run out you
know.
Steve shrugs and turns to Bucky.
BUCKY
That was the easiest battle of the
war.
STEVE
What about you? You gonna follow
Captain America into the jaws of
death?
BUCKY
Hell no. That little guy from
Brooklyn who was too dumb to run
away from a fight? I’m following
him.
Bucky nods at A TOUR POSTER OF CAPTAIN AMERICA: "PERFORMANCE
CANCELLED - NOT TO BE RESCHEDULED."
BUCKY (CONT’D)
But you’re keeping this outfit,
right?

Don’t get your hopes up. It’s not

BUCKY
I dunno. You saw those guys in
Italy when you came back.

I don’t think they were cheering
just for you.
The Invaders SING, arms wrapped drunkenly around one another.
One by one, they stop as they notice...PEGGY ENTERS THE BAR.
Out of uniform, she looks great. Steve is the last to see
her.
PEGGY CARTER (O.S.)
Captain.
STEVE

Agent Carter.
BUCKY
Ma’am.
PEGGY CARTER
Howard’s got some equipment for you

STEVE
That sounds fine.
The Invaders start singing again. Terribly.
PEGGY CARTER
I see your crack squad is prepping

BUCKY
You don’t like music?
PEGGY CARTER

ROBOT CLAWS handle THE CUBE CARTRIDGE inside a blast chamber.
Outside, Howard examines it as his ENGINEER takes notes.
HOWARD STARK
Emission signature is unusual.
Alpha, beta and gamma ray neutral.
Though I doubt Rogers picked up on
that.
Edward gently removes A GLOWING PELLET.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
Hmm. Looks harmless enough.
Howard steers the robot claw, extending A SPARKING WIRE.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
Hard to see what all the fuss is abHe touches the wire to the pellet.
BOOM! AN EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE BLAST CHAMBER
AND SENDS HOWARD SLAMMING AGAINST THE FAR WALL.
When the dust settles, Howard looks over at his engineer.

STEVE (O.S.)
Excuse me, I was looking for Mr.
Stark?
PVT. LORRAINE
(not looking up)
I think he went to look for a
broom.
She looks up. The real-life Steve stands over her. She slips
into a smile.
PVT. LORRAINE (CONT’D)
Of course, you’re welcome to wait.
Steve sits, hesitant. LORRAINE SWIVELS IN HER CHAIR. HE
WATCHES HER LEGS CROSS.
PVT. LORRAINE (CONT’D)
I read about what you did.
STEVE
Oh, I was just doing what needed to
be done.
PVT. LORRAINE
Sounded like more than that. You
saved nearly two hundred men.
STEVE
Really. It wasn’t a big thing.
PVT. LORRAINE
Tell that to their wives.
STEVE
I...don’t think they were all
married.
PVT. LORRAINE
You’re a hero.

STEVE’S EYES GO WIDE AS SHE LEANS IN AND KISSES HIM. HE
STIFFENS...THEN GIVES IN.
When they come up for air...PEGGY STANDS BY THE DESK.
Lorraine leaps back, flustered. Peggy just stares coldly.
PEGGY CARTER
Captain. We’re ready for you...if
you’re not otherwise occupied.
SHE STALKS OUT THE DOOR.
153 INT. ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 153
Peggy clicks down the hall.
STEVE (O.S.)
Agent Carter. Wait a second.
She doesn’t break stride. Steve catches up to her.
PEGGY CARTER
Looks like finding a partner wasn’t
that hard after all.
STEVE
Peggy. That wasn’t what you thought
it was.
PEGGY CARTER
I don’t think anything, Captain.
Not one thing.
She continues toward A METAL DOOR at the end of the hall.
PEGGY CARTER (CONT’D)
You wanted to be a soldier. Now you
are one. Just like all the rest.
Steve stops, flustered and upset.

Peggy whips around, cold.
PEGGY CARTER
You still don’t understand a bloody
thing about women.
She storms down a corridor. Steve watches her to, at a loss.
HOWARD STARK (O.S.)
Fondue’s just cheese and bread, my
friend.
Steve turns. HOWARD STARK stands in the now-open metal door.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
And it looks to me like she thinks
you’ve got a lot more going for you

you’ve got more going for you than

WORKERS REPLACE THE BLAST-SHATTERED WINDOWS. Mechanics tuneup

HOWARD STOPS STEVE AT COLLECTION OF HIGH-TECH FABRICS.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
Me, I concentrate on work. Which at
the moment is making sure you and
your men don’t get killed.
He unrolls an impressive gray metallic weave.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
Carbon polymer. Ought to hold its
own against your average German
bayonet. Of course, Hydra’s not
likely to come at you with a pocket
knife...
He turns to Steve’s BATTERED SHIELD LYING ON A WORKTABLE.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
I hear you’re sort of attached.
Steve fingers a bullet hole.
STEVE
It’s handier than you might think.
HOWARD STARK
So’s the hotel chambermaid, but I
wouldn’t taker her into battle.
He pulls up a cart with A NUMBER OF SHIELDS, some built, some
half-finished (including the one from Iron Man 2).
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
I took the liberty of coming up
with a few options.
(picking one up)
This one’s fun. It’s fitted with
transistorized relays.
Steve pulls out A PLAIN, ROUND SHIELD from the bottom shelf.
He spins it between his palms. It’s light, balanced. Steve
pings the simple shield. IT RINGS LIKE A BELL.
STEVE
What about this one?
HOWARD STARK
Oh, that’s just a prototype. Now
this oneSTEVE
What’s it made of?

154 CONTINUED: 154

HOWARD STARK
Vibranium. Stronger than steel and
a third of the weight.
Steve slides the shield onto his arm.
HOWARD STARK (CONT’D)
It’s completely vibration
absorbent. Should make a bullet
feel like a cotton ball.
BEHIND THEM, PEGGY ENTERS THE LAB.
STEVE
How come it’s not standard issue?
HOWARD STARK
It’s the rarest metal on earth.
You’re holding all we’ve got.
Peggy reaches them, icy.
PEGGY CARTER
Are you about finished, Mr. Stark?
I’m sure the Captain has some
unfinished business.
Steve smiles. She doesn’t. He lifts the shield.
STEVE
What do you think?
PEGGY LOOKS AT HIM, EXPRESSIONLESS. THEN SHE turns to a table
of GUNS, picks one up and FIRES AT STEVE’S CHEST. BLAM, BLAM,
BLAM. HE BLOCKS them. The slugs FLATTEN AND PLINK to the
ground.
PEGGY CARTER
I think it works.
She stalks out of the room. Steve and Howard WATCH HER
GO...FOR A LONG MOMENT.
STEVE
About my uniform...
He hands Howard A SKETCH. NEITHER TAKES HIS EYES OFF PEGGY.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I had some ideas.
HOWARD STARK

THROUGH A SNIPERSCORE: Steve stalks a bombed-out factory.
TITLE: "POLAND, FEBRUARY 1944."
The scope WHIPS to see A HYDRA GUNMAN AIMING AT STEVE. BLAM.
The sniper falls. Steve clocks it and gives the thumbs up to
the camera.

The Invaders scramble out the side doors of a HYDRA FACTORY.
They dive for cover and wait. No explosion. They peer out
from their cover. Where the hell is Steve?
Then...STEVE CRASHES through a factory window on HIS
MOTORCYCLE. BOOM. THE FACTORY BEHIND HIM EXPLODES. He hits
the ground, roaring toward the camera.

161 EXT. FROZEN WOODS - DAY 161
The woods stand white and silent. Then...
SIX WHITE FIGURES rise out of the snow like ghosts.
THE INVADERS SHAKE OFF THE SNOW AND CREEP FORWARD. THEN A
SEVENTH FIGURE RISES: STEVE IN FULL RED, WHITE AND BLUE.
BLAM! A RIFLE CRACKS, A BULLET PINGS OFF HIS SHIELD.
Steve spins and hurls his shield...WHUMP. A HYDRA SNIPER
falls out of a far tree. The Invaders gape.
162 INT. ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 162
Peggy drops a Hydra flag into a box and picks up an SSR flag.
She sticks it in the map.
162A EXT. HYDRA FACTORY - DAY 162A
Steve and Jones ride in the back of a jeep as Dugan drives
away from the burning factory. A HYDRA FIGHTER PLANE swoops
over them, guns blazing.
Steve blocks with his shield as Jones opens up his .30 CAL.
The plane bears down. Jones stitches it up the middle. It
catches fire, spins out of control...AND CRASHES AHEAD OF
THEM.
Dugan slows to a stop. The three of them stare, impressed.
92.
162B EXT. FOREST - DAY 162B
Dernier runs through the woods, A BOMB tucked under his arm.
Parallel to him, a HYDRA FAST-TRACK races along a road.
Dernier rolls UNDER THE FAST-TRACK. He magnets the bomb to
the bottom of the vehicle as it roars over him. He jumps to
his feet in time to see the FAST-TRACK EXPLODE.
163 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY 163
The Invaders race across a field as...THE LANDKRUEZER BEARS
DOWN ON THEM. They’re almost to safety when DUGAN’S HAT FLIES
OFF HIS HEAD, LANDING IN THE PATH OF THE ONCOMING TANK.
DUGAN RUNS BACK FOR IT. The rest of the men shout. Stop!
Dugan dives, grabbing the bowler and rolling out of the way.
He wedges the hat on his head, smug. Then he realizes the
tank has turned...AND IS COMING RIGHT AT HIM.
Then, from nowhere...
STEVE DIVES OVER DUGAN AND GRABS THE TANK’S CANNON BARREL. HE
FLIPS HIMSELF INTO THE AIR AND LANDS ATOP THE TURRET.
Steve spots a GLOWING ENERGY HOUSING, marked: "EXPLOSIVE!" He
raises his shield high and brings it down. WHAM! THE TANK
GRINDS TO A HALT.
Steve raises the shield again. SMASH! THE HOUSE CRACKLES.
SPARKS FLY.
Steve brings the shield down one last time. BOOM! AN OMINOUS
DRONE BEGINS TO RISE. Steve takes a running leap off the
tails as...THE TANK EXPLODES.
FADE TO BLACK AND WHITE. We find we’re in...
164 INT. ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 164
PULL BACK to find Peggy and Phillips watching the footage.
The camera moves past Falsworth and Dernier drinking from
their canteens. Dugan drinks from a flask. Bucky and Steve
survey a valley. The camera focuses on STEVE’S OPEN COMPASS.
Taped to the inside is a NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH...OF PEGGY.
PEGGY LEANS FORWARD, SHOCKED.
The camera whips up. Steve stares right at us, pissed. He
snaps the compass shut.

EXTREME CLOSE ON THE SKULL SCREAMING-a horror-movie jump from

RED SKULL
YOU ARE FAILING!
Zola cringes before him. Around them, HYDRA TROOPS SEARCH THE
RUBBLE OF ANOTHER BURNED FACTORY.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
We are close to an offensive that
will shake the planet, Doctor. Yet
we are continually delayed because
you can’t outwit a simpleton with a
shield!
ALT. ...a clown dressed in a flag!
Zola gestures at the devastated facility.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
Sir, this is hardly my area of
expertise. I merely develop the
weapons, I cannot fire them.
(beat)
And the Allies did not take this
installation easily. Your troops
fought to the death.
RED SKULL
And now they are dead. I trust you
see the problem.
(beat)
Finish your mission, Doctor. Before
the American finishes his.
He puts his hands on either side of Zola’s head, squeezing a
little, bringing their faces close.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
You have done great things. Do this
one more.
Zola contemplates his task.

Zola turns away, his face illuminated briefly by AN
INEVITABLE FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT.
166 EXT. ALPINE PASS - DAY 166
CLOSE ON: THE CAPTURED HYDRA CODE TRANSCEIVER.
TITLE: "RUSSIA, JANUARY 1945."
STEVE AND THE INVADERS GATHER ON A HIGH PLATEAU. Morita
crouches over the transceiver. Jones listens to the
transmission. Falsworth wields binoculars. Dugan and Dernier
adjust a winch at the cliff’s edge. Steve and Bucky stand in
conversation we can’t hear yet.
JONES
The engineer just radioed ahead.
Hydra dispatch gave him permission
to open the throttle.
(slipping off headphones)
Whatever’s on this train, they must
need it bad.
MORITA
Well, they’re not going to get it.
FALSWORTH

BINOCULAR P.O.V.: in the distance, we can see a FAR-OFF,

BUCKY

A TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS THROUGH THE PASS.
BINOCULAR P.O.V.: A FUTURISTIC HYDRA TRAIN APPROACHES.
FALSWORTH
All aboard, gentlemen! Mind the
gap!
Steve, Bucky and Jones attach T-BARS to the cable.
STEVE

Okay, this is a very short, very
fast train. We’ve got a ten-second

Dugan checks the speed of the train against his watch.
DUM DUM DUGAN

He yanks open the next connecting door, stepping into...
171 INT. HYDRA TRAIN, FORWARD CAR - DAY 171
ANOTHER DARKENED CAR. Steve and Bucky creep forward then...
WHAM. A STEEL PLATE DROPS OVER THE DOOR, SEALING THEM IN.
The lights brighten, revealing...A MASSIVE HYDRA TROOPER. SIX
AND A HALF FEET TALL AND HEAVILY ARMORED, BOTH OF HIS ARMS
SPORT HUGE CANNONS.
STEVE AND BUCKY OPEN FIRE, but their machine gun bullets ping
uselessly off the trooper’s armor.
THE TROOPER TAKES AIM AT STEVE...BLAM! THE BLUE PULSE BLOWS
THE SHIELD OUT OF STEVE’S HAND AND SLAMS HIM INTO THE BACK
WALL.
97.
(CONTINUED)
The shield clangs to the floor. The trooper turns to Bucky

MOONLIGHT. A RED LIGHT BLINKS FROM A CAMERA ON THE CEILING.
172 INT. HYDRA TRAIN, ENGINEER’S BOOTH - DAY 172

173 INT. HYDRA TRAIN, FORWARD CAR - DAY 173
THE TROOPER TURNS BACK TO STEVE as he gets to his feet. The
trooper aims at the star on Steve’s chest. BUCKY GRABS
STEVE’S SHIELD OFF THE FLOOR AND LEAPS IN FRONT.
STEVE
Bucky, no!
BLAM! THE CANNON FIRES, HITTING BUCKY SQUARE IN THE
SHIELD...BLOWING HIM THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE WALL. WITH A
LAST DESPERATE EFFORT, BUCK SNAGS THE JAGGED EDGE. THE
TROOPER’S WEAPON IS MOMENTARILY SPENT BY THE BLAST. AS IT
STARTS TO POWER BACK UP...STEVE LUNGES, GRABBING BUCKY’S
SLIPPING HAND. STEVE STARTS PULLING HIM BACK IN. THEN...BLAM.
THE TROOPER FIRES, VAPORIZING BUCKY’S ARM INTO A BLUE MIST.
174 EXT. HYDRA TRAIN, ROOF - DAY 174
On the roof, Jones stares in horror as...
BUCKY’S BODY WHIPS AWAY, TUMBLING INTO A BOTTOMLESS GORGE.
175 INT. HYDRA TRAIN, FORWARD CAR - DAY 175
Steve reaches out in anguish.
STEVE

The only response is wind and the clatter of train wheels.
The trooper takes another step. STEVE GRABS HIS SHIELD AND

KNOCKING THE BLAST AWAY WITH HIS SHIELD. HE ADVANCES.

DR. ARNIM ZOLA
I don’t eat meat.
COLONEL PHILLIPS

COLONEL PHILLIPS
How about cyanide? Does that give

Phillips slides the plate to his side and cuts into the meat
himself, munching contentedly...
COLONEL PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
Every Hydra agent we’ve tried to
take alive has cracked a little
tablet before we could stop them.
But not you. So here’s my brilliant
theory: you want to live.
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
Are you trying to intimidate me,
Colonel?
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I bought you dinner!
He slides a piece of paper over to Zola, who reads aloud:
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
"Given the valuable information he
has provided, and in exchange for
his full cooperation, Doctor Zola
is being remanded to Switzerland -"
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Sent that to DC this morning. Of
course, it was encoded-say, you
haven’t broken those codes, have
you? That’d be awkward...
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
(no confident)
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

He’s still gonna kill you. You’re a

Schmidt than anyone.

Oh, and the last man you cost us

It’s you or him. That’s just what
she dealt.
Zola knows he’s right. Genuine fear tinges his response:
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
By the time you act, it will be too
late. Schmidt believes he walks in
the footsteps of gods. Only the
world itself will satisfy him.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Huh.
(beat)
You do realize that’s nuts, don’t
you?
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
The sanity of the plan is of little
consequence.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
And why’s that?
DR. ARNIM ZOLA
Because he can do it.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
What’s his target?
Zola just looks at him, incredulous.

NOTICES THE GRENADE BURNING BESIDE HIM...BOOM!
186 INT. HYDRA HQ, HANGER - DAY 186
RED SKULL stands beside a HUGE, MYSTERIOUS WHEEL. He toasts
EIGHT PILOTS.
RED SKULL
Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master
on the world, borne to victory on
the wings of the valkyrie. Our
enemies’ weapons will be powerless
against us. If they shoot down one
plane, hundreds more shall rain
fire upon them. If they cut off one
head...
(raising his glass)
Two more shall rake its place!
He drinks. His pilots drink.
PILOTS
HAIL HYDRA!
HYDRA SOLDIERS (O.S.)
HAIL HYDRA!
Skull turns and only now we see, stretching before him...
FIVE HUNDRED SOLDIERS IN FORMATION. They salute in unison.
HYDRA SOLDIERS (CONT’D)
HAIL HYDRA! HAIL HYDRA!
107.
185 CONTINUED: (2) 185
(CONTINUED)
As Skull takes in the devotion, he notices A RED LIGHT
FLASHING ON THE WALL. He slowly turns as, up above...
187 EXT. HYDRA HQ, MOUNTAINTOP - DAY 187
ALARMS SOUND AT THE SURFACE ENTRANCE. BARBED WIRE TOPS AN
EARTHEN-WALLED COMPOUND. HYDRA SOLDIERS race to take
positions. One scrambles to look over the wall, only to
see...STEVE SHOOTING RIGHT AT HIM.
THE BIKE RAMPS OFF A GUN EMPLACEMENT, LAUNCES THROUGH THE
BARBED WIRE AND CRASHES INTO THE COMPOUND.
STEVE CRUSHES ONE GUARD. WHIPPING WIRE SLASHES ANOTHER.
GUARDS OPEN FIRE. Steve swerves, tossing a grenade. BOOM!
ONE GUARD LEVELS A BAZOOKA. STEVE RAISES HIS SHIELD AND
DEFLECTS THE BLAST BACK. Finally, a Hydra rifleman BLOWS OUT
STEVE’S TIRE. STEVE’S FRONT FORK DIGS INTO THE GROUND,
THROWING HIM OVER THE HANDLEBARS.
HE GETS TO HIS FEET, SWINGING, AS DOZENS OF GUARDS MOVE
IN...PUMMELLING HIM FROM ALL SIDES.
188 INT. HYDRA HQ, SCHMIDT’S OFFICE LAB - DAY 188
Guards drag in Steve. He stares up at Skull’s grotesque
portrait. THEN...SKULL STEPS FROM THE SHADOWS. Steve
struggles. THE GUARDS HOLD HIM TIGHT.
RED SKULL (O.S.)
Arrogance may not be a uniquely
American trait...but I will say you
do it better than anyone else.
Skull leans in, TEETH GLEAMING IN HIS CRIMSON FACE.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
There are limits to what even you
can do, Captain. Or did Erskine
tell you otherwise?
STEVE
He told me you were insane. That
seemed like enough.
RED SKULL
He resented my genius and tried to
deny me what was rightfully mine.
Yet he gave you everything.
108.
186 CONTINUED: 186

(CONTINUED)
(almost wounded)
What made you so special?
STEVE
Nothing...
He slowly raises his head, staring INTO SKULL’S SUNKEN EYES.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.
Skull seethes.
He SMASHES STEVE IN THE FACE.
The guards grip Steve’s arms, holding him up as the SKULL
BATTERS HIM. Again and again. After a long time, Skull steps
back. Steve pants, beaten, exhausted. Then finally...HE
SMILES.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I can do this all day.
RED SKULL
I believe you can. But I am on a
schedule.
He pulls his Luger. Steve stares down the barrel.
STEVE
So am I.
THUNK. THUNK. THUNK.
Skull turns toward the window to see...THREE SPECKS IN THE
DISTANCE, FLYING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE GLASS.
Skull spins back to Steve, pistol leveled...ZAP! STEVE SWINGS
A GUARD AROUND, BLOCKING THE BLAST. THE GUARD IS INCINERATED
AS...DUGAN, FALSWORTH, AND JONES SMASH THROUGH THE WINDOW ON
ZIPLINES. JONES LANDS ON SKULL’S DESK, BLASTING AWAY WITH HIS
.30 CAL.
188A INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 188A
The zipline extends from A POWERFUL GRAPPLING GUN. DERNIER
hooks to the wire and shoots away. MORITA barks into his
radio.
MORITA

MORITA (ON RADIO)
Assault team! Go!
ATOP A RIDGE, COLONEL PHILLIPS STANDS.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
You heard him! Move out!
PEGGY AND HUNDREDS OF ALLIED TROOPS SLIP OUT OF HIDING.
Phillips looks to Peggy. He cocks a shotgun.
188B EXT. HYDRA HQ, MOUNTAINTOP - DAY 188B
UP TOP, ALLIED SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE, POURING INTO THE COMPOUND.
188C INT. HYDRA HQ, SCHMIDT’S OFFICE LAB - DAY 188C
DUGAN LANDS A HAYMAKER. STEVE KNOCKS OUT THE OTHER GUARD.
SKULL GETS OFF A FEW BLASTS AS HE BACK OUT THE DOOR. DOWN THE
HALL, ALLIED SOLDIERS BLOW THROUGH THE DOUBLE DOORS.
Falsworth cuts down a guard, taking THE SHIELD from him. He
tosses it to Steve.
STEVE
Thanks.
FALSWORTH
Cheers.
Steve straps on the shield and races after Skull.
189 INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 189
FOUR HYDRA TROOPERS back up to the entrance, firing. BLAM!
One falls, shot. A second tries to lob a grenade. BLAM! He
falls, dropping the grenade at the feet of the third. BOOM!
Trapped, the last one panics, TONGUE FUMBLING IN HIS MOUTH.
HYDRA SOLDIER
Cut off one head, two more shall
riseBLAM. The soldier falls dead.
REVERSE: COLONEL PHILLIPS STANDS THERE, SHOTGUN SMOKING.
110.
(CONTINUED)
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Let’s go find two more.
A DOZEN MARINES FOLLOW HIM INSIDE.
190 INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 190
Skull runs down a corridor, jackboots pounding. Steve tears
after him, racing around the corner, only to be met by a
VICIOUS BARRAGE. Schmidt unloads his Luger, BLASTING BLUE
BOLTS. Steve barely gets his shield up in time.
191 OMITTED 191
192 INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 192
Schmidt races PAST AN INTERSECTING CORRIDOR. He dashes
through a doorway and hits a button: BLAST DOORS BEGIN TO
CLOSE.
Steve spots the closing doors. He calculates and HURLS HIS
SHIELD. It whirls down the corridor and...THUNK, JAMS BETWEEN
THE DOORS, HOLDING THEM OPEN. Steve takes off after
Schmidt...BUT A HYDRA FLAME TROOPER STOMPS OUT OF THE
INTERSECTING CORRIDOR, BLOCKING HIS WAY. The flame trooper
raises his twin guns. Steve raises his arm, only to
realize...HIS SHIELD IS STUCK IN THE DOOR. Uh-oh. Blue fire
flickers from the trooper’s nozzles. Then...
BLAM! The trooper staggers. THE TANK ON HIS BACK EXPLODES.
PEGGY steps out of the corridor, RIFLE IN HAND.
STEVE
You’re late.
PEGGY CARTER
Tell me you’re not complaining.
(nodding at the door)
Weren’t you about to...?
STEVE
Right.
He sprints for the door, sliding below the shield, grabbing
it as he goes. The doors slam behind him.
Peggy waves ON A SQUAD OF SSR TROOPS BEHIND HER.
111.
189 CONTINUED: 189
193 INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 193
DERNIER and FALSWORTH fight along a corridor, OUTNUMBERED.
Falsworth nods to Dernier. THEY RETREAT around a bend.
SURPRISED, THE HYDRA TROOPERS GIVE CHASE. After a
moment...THE HYDRA TROOPERS COME RUNNING BACK. DUGAN STEPS
OUT, FIRING A HYDRA CANNON. BLAM!
194 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 194
INSIDE THE BOMBER, DIM MONITORS LINE AN IMPRESSIVE COCKPIT. A
HIGH-TECH CRADLE STANDS IN THE CENTER.
Skull approaches, carrying the TITANIUM BOX. He places it
over the cradle and dispenses...THE CUBE. Blue circuits
flash. LIGHTS AND GAUGES FLICKER.
195 INT. HYDRA HQ, CORRIDOR - DAY 195
Steve runs toward another door. BEYOND, A HUGE HANGER LOOMS.
Suddenly, A DEEP RUMBLING SHAKES THE BASE. Steve gapes.
Through the doorway, he sees...A GIGANTIC PLANE ROLLS PAST.
IT DWARFS ANY WE’VE EVER SEEN.
196 INT. HYDRA HQ, HANGER - DAY 196
Steve skids into the hanger. The massive plane taxies down
the runway. In the shadows, FIVE MORE BOMBERS WAIT. Schmidt’s
plane picks up speed. STEVE TAKES OFF AFTER IT.
197 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 197
Skull throttles up. He presses a button.
198 INT. HYDRA HQ, HANGER - DAY 198
At the far end, A DOOR OPENS, letting in THE GLARE OF
DAYLIGHT. STEVE CHASES AFTER THE PLANE, but the huge bomber
picks up speed. It starts to pull away. Suddenly, AN ENGINE
REVS. SCHMIDT’S CAR comes up alongside the still-running
STEVE, COLONEL PHILLIPS behind the wheel.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
Get in.
STEVE JUMPS IN without the car ever slowing down. In the
back, PEGGY CHAMBERS A ROUND INTO PHILLIPS’ SHOTGUN.
112.
199 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 199
Skull accelerates. On his monitor, he spies...HIS CAR.
200 INT. HYDRA HQ, HANGER - DAY 200
Phillips gains on the plane. Just then, the BOMBER’S REAR
PROPELLERS SPIN INTO A BLUR. The plane widens the gap.
Phillips spots a TOGGLE SWITCH on the dash, "KOMPRESSOR." He
hits it. WHOOSH. THE CAR LEAPS FORWARD, THROWING THEM BACK.
Steve climbs over the windshield and steadies himself.
STEVE
Closer!
Phillips floors it. The car surges toward THE PROPELLERS.
STEVE DROPS just as the propellers SHAVE OFF THE HYDRA HOOD
ORNAMENT. He and Peggy share a worried look.
201 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 201
Skull races for the mouth of the tunnel. On the monitor...
202 INT. HYDRA HQ, HANGER - DAY 202
PHILLIPS COMES UP ALONGSIDE THE PLANE’S HUGE TIRE.
STEVE
Hold it steady this time.
PEGGY CARTER
Wait!
Peggy grabs Steve by the neck AND KISSES HIM. When they break
off, Steve looks at her, wide-eyed.
PEGGY CARTER (CONT’D)
Go get him.
Steve nods, stunned. He looks to Phillips.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
I’m not kissing you!
203 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 203
Skull punches the throttle, the SPEEDOMETER RED-LINING.
113.
204 INT. HYDRA HQ, HANGER - DAY 204
Steve braces himself on the hood. Phillips pulls to within
inches of THE SPINNING WHEEL. JUST THEN...
205 EXT. HYDRA HQ, CLIFF - DAY 205
THE PLANE BURSTS OUT OF THE TUNNEL. PHILLIPS SPOTS THE GORGE
AHEAD. HE SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. AT THE LAST MOMENT, STEVE
LEAPS...SNAGGING THE LANDING GEAR. THE PLANE SHOOTS OVER THE
EDGE, SAILING INTO THE AIR. Phillips skids to a stop. Peggy
sees STEVE HANGING ON.
206 EXT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, LANDING GEAR - DAY 206
Steve locks his arm around a strut. THE PLANE GAINS ALTITUDE.
He looks for a way in. Just then...THE LANDING GEAR GROANS.
THE WHEELS RETRACT. STEVE FINDS HIMSELF RIDING THE LANDING
GEAR RIGHT INTO...
207 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, FLIGHT DECK - DAY 207
The flight deck. STEVE STARES, AWESTRUCK. He realizes the
propellers are attached to EIGHT FIGHTERS INSIDE THE WING.
Each features a snub-nose CUBE BOMB as its nosecone.
ZING. A BULLET RICOCHETS off Steve’s shield. He spins
as...THE EIGHT PILOTS RUSH DOWN A RAMP FROM THE BRIDGE. STEVE
flips into a flying spin kick, dropping two pilots where they
stand. THE OTHERS MOVE IN ON HIM. He throws one across the
flight deck and out of the plane. He smashes another with his
shield.
A HUGE PILOT FACES OFF AGAINST STEVE. HE SWINGS A CHOCK,
CLOCKING STEVE IN THE HEAD. STEVE STAGGERS ONTO A FIGHTER.
THE BIG PILOT LEAPS ON HIM.
Inside the FIGHTER’S COCKPIT, ANOTHER PILOT sees his chance.
He pulls THE RELEASE LEVER...THE FIGHTER DROPS, WITH STEVE
AND THE PILOT STILL ABOARD.
208 INT./EXT. POD FIGHTER - DAY 208
Steve holds on as the fighter shoots through the air. The big
pilot hangs on to Steve’s boot. STEVE KICKS. ONCE. TWICE. THE
BIG PILOT LOSES HIS GRIP, TUMBLING INTO THE PROPELLER.
Inside, the fighter pilot looks up, astounded to see Steve
still hanging on.
114.
(CONTINUED)
HE EXECUTES A BARREL-ROLL. STEVE’S EYES ROLL BACK, SKIN
RIPPLING FROM THE G-FORCE. THE PILOT JERKS THE STICK...BUT
STEVE HAULS HIMSELF FORWARD. HE GRASPS THE EDGE OF THE
COCKPIT AND SLIDES IT OPEN.
The pilot evades Steve’s grasping hand. Then Steve reaches
down and PULLS THE EJECTOR SWITCH. THE PILOT BLASTS INTO THE
SKY, SMASHING INTO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BOMBER’S WING. Steve
climbs in and hauls on the stick, righting the plane.
209 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 209
Skull checks AN ELECTRONIC MAP, showing the plane’s progress
toward America. Then he looks out the windshield...AND
FREEZES. STEVE’S RAGGED FIGHTER COMES SWOOPING UP OUT OF THE
CLOUDS, PROPELLER WHIRLING.
210 INT. POD FIGHTER - DAY 210
Steve yanks the stick, flying shakily toward THE FLIGHT DECK.
211 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, FLIGHT DECK - DAY 211
STEVE’S POD-FIGHTER SKIDS ACROSS THE FLIGHT DECK...FINALLY
COMING TO A STOP IN A SHOWER OF SPARKS AND SCREECHING METAL.
Steve pushes the canopy off and climbs from the wreck. He
straps on his shield and looks toward THE COCKPIT...
212 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 212
Steve kicks open the door to find...STILLNESS. He steps
warily toward THE CONTROL PLATFORM. HE SEES THE PILOT’S CHAIR
EMPTY. Suddenly, he hears THE WHINE OF A HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE
POWERING UP. His eyes dart to the window, where he sees a
reflection of SKULL AIMING AT HIS BACK. Steve whips around,
shield raised, deflecting Skull’s shot. THE BLAST RICOCHETS,
BLOWING OUT A PANE OF THE COCKPIT GLASS. WIND ROARS.
RED SKULL
You don’t give up, do you?
STEVE
Nope.
Steve charges at Skull, who fires again. Blue bolts ricochet
around the cabin. Steve swings, bashing the rifle from
Skull’s hands. Skull swings. Steve puts Skull in a headlock.
Skull throws Steve into a bulkhead.
115.
208 CONTINUED: 208
(CONTINUED)
STEVE SWINGS HIS SHIELD, BUT SKULL GRABS IT WITH BOTH HANDS.
THE TWO SUPER SOLDIERS STRAIN, EYE TO EYE.
RED SKULL
You wear a flag on your chest and
think you fight a battle of
nations? I have seen the future,
Captain. There are no flags but
Hydra’s.
STEVE
Keep the future. I’m looking for a
little here and now.
STEVE SLAMS SKULL IN THE JAW WITH THE SHIELD. SKULL STAGGERS.
STEVE COCKS BACK AND HITS SKULL WITH AN UPPERCUT.
The impact drives Skull up and into...THE AUTO PILOT
CONTROLS.
THE AUTOPILOT DISENGAGES. THE PLANE LURCHES VIOLENTLY.
212A EXT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER - DAY 212A
THE MASSIVE PLANE SPINS INTO A BARREL ROLL. Through the
cockpit window, we see Steve and Skull tumbling to the
ceiling.
212B INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 212B
STEVE AND SKULL CRASH ACROSS THE WHIRLING COCKPIT. Steve
grasps for a handhold.
The plane jerks again, throwing them together. THEY BATTLE IN
CHAOTIC ZERO-G.
Steve powers Skull into the ceiling.
Skull elbows Steve into the wall.
Skull tries to reach the autopilot.
BUT STEVE USES HIS MOMENTUM TO SWING AROUND A STRUT AND SLAMS
HIS SHIELD INTO SKULL’S HEAD.
Skull bashes against the wall, but adeptly bounces back. He
grabs a strut and kicks Steve toward the back bulkhead. Skull
flies at the autopilot controls.
WHAM. STEVE SLAMS HARD INTO THE STEEL WALL. SKULL FINDS A
HANDHOLD AND HITS THE AUTOPILOT BUTTON.
116.
212 CONTINUED: 212
212C EXT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER - DAY 212C
The giant plane pulls out of its dive.
212D INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 212D
GRAVITY RETURNS with sudden violence. STEVE SMASHES TO THE
FLOOR, HIS SHIELD ROLLING AWAY. Steve lies momentarily dazed.
His eyes flutter. Then...
RED SKULL (O.S.)
You could have the power of the
gods...
Steve looks up to see Skull advancing, LUGER DRAWN.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
And you will not admit you want it?
Standing in front of the cube housing, Skull takes dead aim
at the star on Steve’s chest.
STEVE
I want what every soldier on every
battlefield wants...
Steve eyes the shield at his feet.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I want to go home.
ALT. I want this war to end.
Steve slams his heel onto the shield, flipping it into the
air. SKULL FIRES. Steve jumps to his feet, grabbing the
shield, blocking the blast. He whirls and hurls his shield.
The spinning disc hits Skull in the ribs with a sickening
crunch, knocking him off his feet...SMASHING HIM INTO THE
CUBE CONSOLE.
Blue energy arcs and crackles from the damaged machinery. THE
ENERGY GAUGE PINS AT OVERLOAD.
Skull pulls himself to his feet, staring in alarm as...
The cube rises from the machine, glowing with a violent
intensity.
SKULL STARES. HE REACHES OUT AND EXTRACTS THE CUBE. STEVE
GAPES AS...THE CUBE BURNS THE GLOVE OFF SKULL’S HAND,
EXPOSING THE SCARRED FLESH.
117.
(CONTINUED)
THE SKULL JUST STARES, OVERCOME AND AMAZED. Blinded by the
light, Steve staggers toward the controls.
SKULLS P.O.V.:
THE PLANE SEEMS TO VANISH AROUND HIM. VISIONS OF THE NINE
REALMS DANCE IN THE LIGHT: A RAINBOW PORTAL STRETCHES PAST AN
OBSERVATORY AND INTO SPACE.
RED SKULL
Valhalla...
ALT. I was right...
ALT. It is real...
ALT. Yes, I understand...
ALT. I have waited so long...
THE VISIONS SPEED UP UNTIL THEY BLUR. SUDDENLY, THE CUBE
VIBRATES VIOLENTLY. The Skull looks worried. Something’s
wrong.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
No.
STEVE WHIPS UP HIS SHIELD AS ENERGY SHOOTS FROM THE CUBE.
RED SKULL (CONT’D)
NO!
ENERGY BOLTS RICOCHET OFF THE CEILING AND STRIKE THE SKULL,
VAPORIZING HIM AS...
THE CUBE GOES NOVA.
213 EXT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER - DAY 213
A MASSIVE COLUMN OF ENERGY SHOOTS TOWARD SPACE, GROWING IN
INTENSITY UNTIL IT EXPLODES OUTWARDS, EVAPORATING THE CLOUDS.
Light glares through the cockpit windows. Then fades. The
plane whips past.
214 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 214
Steve stands, woozy. When his vision returns, he sees...THE
INERT CUBE. He takes a step toward it...SUDDENLY, THE PLANE
BANKS VIOLENTLY, ITS ENGINES ROARING. Steve races for the
controls. The forgotten cube tumbles across the flight deck.
Tink...Tink...Tink...AND FLIES OUT A HOLE IN THE FUSELAGE.
118.
212D CONTINUED: 212D
(CONTINUED)
Steve climbs into the chair. THE CONTROL STICK steers
automatically. Steve wrestles it, trying to override the
plane...BUT IT WILL NOT ALTER COURSE. Steve stares at the
monitor AND THE GREEN MAP OF MANHATTAN.
215 INT. HYDRA HQ, CONTROL TOWER - DAY 215
THE RADIO SQUAWKS in the empty control room.
STEVE (ON RADIO)
Agent Carter, come in...
Peggy runs in and grabs the radio, frantic and relieved.
PEGGY CARTER
Steve, is that you? Are you okay?
STEVE (ON RADIO)
I’m fine.
THROUGH THE WINDOW, WE SEE THE INVADERS ROUNDING UP THE
SURRENDERED HYDRA MEN.
PEGGY CARTER
Where’s Schmidt?
STEVE (ON RADIO)
Schmidt’s dead.
PEGGY CARTER
What about the plane?
STEVE (ON RADIO)
That’s a little bit harder to
explain.
INTERCUT:
216 INT. SUBORBITAL BOMBER, COCKPIT - DAY 216
Steve stares at the New York map, radio in hand. HIS COMPASS
lies open on the control board.
PEGGY CARTER
Give me your coordinates. I’ll find
a landing site119.
214 CONTINUED: 214

STEVE
There isn’t going to be a landing.
Schmidt’s locked the navigation
system.
Steve eyes THE RELINED ENGINE GAUGES in front of him.
STEVE (CONT’D)
And there’s more than enough power
to reach the East Coast.
Peggy looks grave. She waves Colonel Phillips down.
PEGGY CARTER
I’ll get Howard on the line. He’ll
know what to do.
STEVE
I’m sitting on a hundred tons of
explosives. Hotwiring this thing’s
not an option.
He looks out the window at the vast, blue expanse of ocean.
STEVE (CONT’D)
I’ve got to put her in the water.
Peggy spreads her fingers on the wall, her knuckles white.
PEGGY CARTER
But you said you couldn’t steer it.
Steve scans the control panel. HE SPOTS A THICK CABLE RUNNING
FROM THE IGNITION TO THE ENGINES.
STEVE
I can’t. But I think I can crash
it.
HE YANKS THE CABLE OUT. BLUE SPARKS FLARE. THEN ALL THE
LIGHTS DIE. THE ENGINES STOP. THE PLANE GOES QUIET.
PEGGY CARTER
Steve, don’t do this. We’ve got
time. We can figure this out.
Steve eyes THE NAVIGATION CHARTS.
STEVE
I already did. Right now, I’m in
the middle of nowhere. If I wait
any longer, a lot of people are
going to get hurt.

Peggy, this is my choice.
Peggy and Phillips look at each other, slowly accepting
what’s happening.
PEGGY CARTER
We’ll send out rescue ships. We’ll
find you.
STEVE
I don’t think there’s going to be
much left to find.
STEVE LEANS ON THE STICK WITH ALL HIS MIGHT. THE PLANE BEGINS
A SCREAMING DIVE.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Peggy?
PEGGY CARTER
I’m here.
STEVE’S COMPASS SPINS WILDLY. HE JUST STARES AT HER PICTURE.
STEVE
I’m going to need a raincheck on
that dance.
PEGGY CARTER
(holding back tears)
All right. A week Saturday. The
Stork Club.
STEVE
Okay. You got it.
PEGGY CARTER
8:00 on the dot. If you’re three
minutes late I’m leaving, do you
understand?
STEVE
I still don’t know how to dance.
She closes her eyes.
PEGGY CARTER
I’ll show you. I’ll show you
everything. Just be there.

Clouds whip past the windows as the plane plummets. STEVE
POCKETS THE COMPASS AND SLIDES HIS MASK OVER HIS FACE. ARCTIC
ICE RUSHES UP AT THE COCKPIT WINDOW.
STEVE
Maybe the band could play something
slow, I’d hate to step on yourHISS. The radio in Peggy’s hand goes silent. Colonel Phillips
puts a hand on her shoulder. She just stares out the hanger
at the blue sky beyond.
217 EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN - DAY 217
THE PLANE SKIDS VIOLENTLY ACROSS A GLACIER. IT CAREENS OFF
THE EDGE AND CRASHES INTO AN ICY LAKE. The plane floats a
moment, then starts to sink. BLEED IN THE SOUND OF A CHEERING
CROWD...
218 EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE - DAY 218
People lean from balconies, holding the V for Victory sign. A
paper on a newsstand reads, "WAR OVER!"
218A INT. THE WHIP & FIDDLE PUB - DAY 218A
Amidst the revelry, MORITA, JONES, DERNIER, FALSWORTH and

221 INT. STARK SEARCH BOAT, WHEELHOUSE - DAY 221
HOWARD STARK hunches over a MONITOR on a high-tech bridge.
His assistants eye SONAR and RADIATION DETECTORS. ONE

ON HOWARD’S SCREEN: grainy video footage of the sea bottom.
Sand and fish roll past as the camera explores the terrain.
Howard peers. He stops the camera sub, adjusts the monitor,
bringing into focus...
THE CRACKED, INERT...COSMIC CUBE.
He operates a pair of joysticks. ON SCREEN, two robotic claws
extend. They reach out and clasp the cube. Howard exhales and
looks to his assistants.
HOWARD STARK
Move us to the next grid point.
STARK ASSISTANT
But there’s no trace of wreckage,
sir. And the energy signature stops
here.
Stark pushes back from the monitor, spent, grim.
HOWARD STARK
Just keep looking.

THE PLANE’S WINGTIP SLIPS BELOW THE ICE.
223 OMITTED 223
224 EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY 224
WE SEE STEVE’S SHADOW THROUGH THE COCKPIT WINDOW. HE SLUMPS,
STRAPPED IN HIS CHAIR.
225 INT. ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 225
Phillips signs and official report. "CLASSIFIED-CAPTAIN
AMERICA." He stamps it: "INACTIVE." He slides it into a red
box marked "TO BE DESTROYED." He looks up as Peggy walks in.
He regards her, stoic, suppressing his emotion.
COLONEL PHILLIPS
ALT. No one said we have to forget
the man, Agent.
Peggy nods. She picks up the box and puts it with others on a
table near the door. For a moment, she just stands there,
overwhelmed.
123.
221 CONTINUED: 221

She opens the box, taking out A PHOTO OF PRE-REBIRTH STEVE.
She smiles. Then she tucks it in her breast pocket. She

226 EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY 226
BACK AWAY FROM THE WINDOW UNTIL THE PLANE IS JUST A SHADOW.
227 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY 227
On a New York street, TWO BOYS PLAY. One fires a toy gun. The
other blocks imaginary bullets with A GARBAGE CAN LID.
FADE TO BLACK.
After a moment, we can hear, ever so faintly...THE SOUND OF A
BROOKLYN DODGERS GAME ON THE RADIO.
228 EXT. 1945 ROOM - DAY 228
CLOSE ON: STEVE’S FACE. He looks paler, thinner...but alive.
His eyes flicker open. He sees and old glass light fixture on
a white ceiling. He sits up and finds he’s on a bed in a
quiet, 1940s room. The sun shines through white curtains. The
Dodgers game plays on AN OLD VACUUM TUBE RADIO on a wooden
dresser.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
"Workman up for the Phillies, now.
Holding that big club down at the
end. He sets, Chipman pitches.
Curveball, outside. Ball one."
Steve slides his bare feet to the worn, wooden floor.
SSR AGENT
Good morning.
Steve turns to sees A PRETTY 1940S BRUNETTE sitting in a
chair. She folds a copy of The Brooklyn Eagle and checks her
watch.
SSR AGENT (CONT’D)

of making it a brand new game."
Steve eyes the radio. He takes a long look at her.
STEVE
How long have I been out?
RADIO ANNOUNCER
"Outfield deep, round toward left,
the infield overshifted."
SSR AGENT
I’m afraid I couldn’t sayWith lightning speed, Steve GRABS her arm.
SSR AGENT (CONT’D)
Captain Rogers, please!
STEVE
Who are you? How do you know my
name?
SSR AGENT
(wincing)
We know all about you.
Just then, A LARGE, MENACING MAN in strangely modern garb
rushes into the room. He carries a set of METAL RESTRAINTS.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
"Here’s the pitch from Chipman..."
Steve lets go of the SSR AGENT. He stares, red-eyed at THE
MAN MOVES IN ON HIM...
RADIO ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
"Swung on, belted, it’s a long one,
deep into left center, back goes
Galan. Back, back, back..."
125.
228 CONTINUED: 228
229 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 229
SUDDENLY, BAM! A DOOR EXPLODES INTO THE HALLWAY, BLOWN OFF
ITS HINGES BY THE FLYING BODY OF THE MANACLE MAN. STEVE
STAGGERS OUT.
230 OMITTED 230
231 INT. LOBBY - DAY 231
Steve races into a busy, modern lobby. SHIELD operatives
stare. MP’S appear ahead of him.
SHIELD MP
Halt!
Steve bowls them over and runs for the door...
232A EXT. SHIELD HOSPITAL - DAY 232A
Steve burst outside. He takes a few steps...THEN STOPS.
MODERN CARS HONK AND ROAR IN THE STREET. TOWERING PLASMA
BILLBOARDS PLAY MOVING ADS FEATURING LOTS OF FLESH. MODERN
PEOPLE RUSH PAST, IPODS AND CELL PHONES TO THEIR EARS. STEVE
STAGGERS, CONFUSED. HE GLANCES OVER HIS SHOULDER TO SEE THE
MP’S RUSHING OUT. STEVE TAKES OFF, SPRINTING DOWN THE CROWDED
SIDEWALK.
233 EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEYWAY - DAY 233
Steve skids into an alley and stops, panting, freaked. Steve
looks down the alley...ONLY TO FIND IT’S A DEAD END.
NICK FURY (O.S.)
At ease, soldier.
Steve whips to see...NICK FURY standing alone at the alley
entrance.
STEVE
Who are you?
NICK FURY
Colonel Fury, Director of SHIELD.
You would have known us as the
Special Scientific Reserve.
Steve’s eyes narrow. The first reassuring thing he’s heard.
126.
(CONTINUED)
STEVE
Where am I?
NICK FURY
Round about 34th and 5th.
Steve looks confused. Fury nods over his shoulder at...THE
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING RISING ABOVE THEM. STEVE GAPES. Fury
waves a couple of MP’s to block off the alley. They stand at
attention.
NICK FURY (CONT’D)
Sorry about that little show back
there. See, there’s no precedent
for what you’ve been through. We
couldn’t tell how delicate your
mental state might be. We thought
it best to break it to you slowly.
STEVE
Break what?
NICK FURY
You’ve been asleep, Captain. For
almost seventy years.
Steve looks around, stunned.
STEVE
Seventy...
(sledge-hammered)
The World of the Future.
NICK FURY
Well, thanks to you, there is one.
Steve eyes Fury.
STEVE
What about the war? Did we win?
NICK FURY
Hell, yes. Unconditional surrender,
baby. And taking down HYDRA was a
big part of that.
Steve reels
STEVE
How am I...not dead?
127.
233 CONTINUED: 233
(CONTINUED)
NICK FURY
To be perfectly honest, we’re not
sure yet. My docs day it’s some
kind of suspended animation. Dr.
Erskine’s formula, the extreme
cold...I can’t break it down for
you on a cellular level, but you
haven’t aged a day since that plane
went down.
Steve looks around, overwhelmed. Above him, a highway sign
reads "FDR DRIVE, NEXT LEFT."
NICK FURY (CONT’D)
You don’t mind my asking, what gave
us away back there?
STEVE
What? Oh. Bob Chipman was traded
for Eddie Stanky during the ‘44
season. He’s with the Cubs now.
(troubled)
Or...was.
NICK FURY
I know it’s a lot to swallow. But
the world’s not as different as it
looks. There’s still work to be
done...
(pointed)
Soldier’s work.
Steve meets Fury’s eyes. Fury signals to one of the MP’s. He
brings forward A CASE. Fury opens it, revealing STEVE’S
BATTERED SHIELD.
NICK FURY (CONT’D)
The world could still use a man
like you, Cap.
Steve touches the shield, remembering.
NICK FURY (CONT’D)
Take your time. God knows if
anybody’s earned it, you have. All
the same...
Fury offers his hand. Steve takes it.
NICK FURY (CONT’D)
There’s a place for you on the
team.
128.
233 CONTINUED: (2) 233
(CONTINUED)
Steve rubs his head, so many things coming back.
NICK FURY (CONT’D)
You sure you’re all right?
STEVE
Yeah. It’s just...
PUSH IN on Steve’s stunned face.
STEVE (CONT’D)
(quietly)
I have a date.
FADE OUT.
129.
