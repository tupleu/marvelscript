GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
EARTH 1998
Young Peter Quill sits in the hallway listening to his walkman.
 GRANPA
Peter
Your momma wants to speak with you.
Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off.
 PETER'S DYING MOM
Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby?
Peter?
YOUNG PETER QUILL
They killed a little frog that ain't done nothing.
Smushed it with a stick.
PETER'S DYING MOM
You're so like your daddy. You even look like him. And he was an angel. Composed out of pure
light.
 GRANPA
Mer? You got a present there for Peter, don't you?
PETER'S DYING MOM
Of course. There.
 GRANPA
I've got you covered, Pete.
PETER'S DYING MOM
You open it up when I'm gone, okay? Your grandpa is gonna take such good care of you. At least
until your daddy comes back to get you. Take my hand. Peter.
 GRANPA
Pete, come on.
PETER'S DYING MOM
Take my hand.
(Peter's mom dies)
YOUNG PETER QUILL
Mom? No! No! No! No! Mom! No.
 GRANPA
Come with me.
YOUNG PETER QUILL
No! No! 

 GRANPA
You've got to stay here. Please.
YOUNG PETER QUILL
No...
 GRANPA
Okay?
YOUNG PETER QUILL
No. Mom.
Peter's mom dies and he is kidnapped by aliens.
26 YEARS LATER
MORAG
ABADONED PLANET
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Drop it.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey...
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Drop it now!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, cool man. No problem. No problem at all.
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
How do you know about this?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I don't even know what that is. I'm just a junker man. I was just checking stuff out.
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
You don't look like a junker. You're wearing Ravager garb.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
This is just an outfit, man. Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
What is your name?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude chill out.
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Move!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Why?
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Ronan may have questions for you.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey you know what? There's another name you might know me by. Star-Lord. 

 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Who?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. Guys?
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Move!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Forget this.
(Start a fight. Peter runaway and entered into his ship)
 BEREET
Peter? What happened?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey... I...
 BEREET
Bereet.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Bereet! Look, I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I forget you're here.
"Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today protesting the recent peace treaty signed by
the Kree Emperor and Xandar's Nova Prime"
 BEREET
Peter, you have call.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No, wait, don't!
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Quill?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, Yondu.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I'm here on Morag. Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd save you the hassle.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Well, where are you at now, boy?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I feel really bad about this, but I'm not gonna tell you that.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I slaved putting this deal together.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Slave? Making a few calls is "slaved"? I mean, really? And how you're gonna rip me off!
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
We do not do that to each other. We're Ravagers. We got a code.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, and that code is "steal from everybody"
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
When I picked you up on Terra...
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
"Picked me up"
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah?
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
They ain't never tasted any Terran before. I stopped them. You're alive because of me! I will find
you, I will...
(Peter hung up the phone line with Yondu)
(In Yondu's Ship)
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Put a bounty on him! Forty K. But I want him back alive.
 FORTY K
Yeah, Cap.
YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Alive?
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
That's what I said.
YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
I told you when you picked that kid up, you should have delivered him like we was hired to do! He
was cargo! You have always been soft on him.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
You're the only one I'm being soft on! Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill. As soon as we get him
back here, I'm gonna kill him myself. What we do need to worry about, is who else out there wants
that Orb!
THE DARK ASTER
KREE WARSHIP
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
They call me "terrorist", "radical", "zealot", because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,
and punish those who do not. Because I do not forgive your people for talking the life of my father,
and his father, and his father before him. A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!
 XANDARIANs
You can't do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
My government knows no shame. You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.
 XANDARIANs
You will never rule Xandar. 

 RONAN (Lee Pace)
No. I will cure it!
(Ronan hit the man's head until his blood streaming down)
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan, Korath has returned.
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Master, he is a thief, an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord. But we have discovered he has an
agreement to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known as The Broker.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him. Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
It will be my honor.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
It will be your doom. If this happens again, you'll be facing our father without his prize.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
I'm a daughter of Thanos. Just like you.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
But I know Xandar.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan has already decreed that I...
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Do not speak for me. You will not fail.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Have I ever?
XANDAR
CAPITAL OF THE NOVA EMPIRE
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Xandarians. What a bunch of losers. All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to
nothing at all. Pathetic. Look at this guy! Can you believe they call us criminals, when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?
(Looking toward a little children)
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it's cool. It's not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little
gargoyle.
(Looking towards an oldman and a girl)
Look at Mr. Smiles over here. Where's your wife, old man? What a class-A pervert. Hahaha... Right,
Groot? Groot?
(Groot were having drinking on the fountain water)
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot. That's disgusting!
(Groot shook his head)
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it! Why are you lying?
(tet..tet..tet..)
Looks like we got one. Okay, homie, how bad does someone wanna find you?
(Wanted: Peter Quill)
40,000 units? Groot we're gonna be rich.


(In Broker's place)
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Mr. Quill.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Broker. The Orb. As commissioned.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Where's Yondu?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wanted to be here. Sends his love. And fold me to tell you, that you got the best eyebrows in this
business. What is it?
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
It's my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill. I truly am. But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Who's Ronan?
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is
wiped from existence!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Come on.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
He's someone whose bad side I'd rather not be on.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What? What about my bad side?
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Farewell, Mr. Quill.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, we had a deal, bro!
(Broker pushes out Peter from his workplace and closed the door from the inside, in the outside Peter
met with Gamora)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What happened? 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
This guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there's one this I hate. It's a man without integrity. Peter
Quill. People call me Star-Lord.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You have the bearing of a man of honor.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.
(Gamora stole the Orb from Peter and kick him, and then they are start fighting)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
This wasn't the plan. (Gamora want to stab Peter and Rocket came to attack Gamora)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag! No! Not her, him! Learn genders, man. Bitting? That's not
fair! (Peter ran away and bring the Orb)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Take it easy!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Fool. You should have learned.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I don't learn. One of my issues.
(Groot closed Peter's head using a bag)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What the...
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional. You gotta be kidding me.
(Gamora comeback again)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hey! (Gamora pushing Rocket then have a fight with Groot)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I live for the simple things. Like how much this gonna hurt. Yeah. Writhe, little man. It'll grow back,
you the ast idiot. (Groot kicked his hand that broken)
Quit whining. (Suddenly they uplifted)
Subject 89 P13, drop your weapon.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Crap.
By the authority of the Nova Corps, you all under arrest...
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
All right. Come on up.
For endangerment to life and the destruction of property.
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince. 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Star-Lord.
Sorry. "Lord".
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
I picked this guy up awhile back for petty thief. He's got a code name
Yeah. Stay out of the way.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Come on, man. It's a... It's an outlaw name.
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
Just relax, pal. It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Fascists.
(They are arrested)

NOVA HEADQUARTERS
XANDAR’S ARMED FORCES
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Ronan is destroying Xandarian out posts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for
some slight response on the part of the Kree.
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want?
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering
children. Families.
That is you business. Now, I have other matters to attend. (turn off the phone)
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Prick.
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
Well, some good news. It look like we've apprehended one of Ronan's compatriots.
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan,
Thanos. Recently, Thanos lend her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that
Thanos and Ronan working together.
Subject 89P13. Call itself "Rocket". The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a
lower life form.
What the hell?
They call it "Groot". A humanoid plant that's been traveling recently as 89P13's personal
houseplantlmuscle.
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led
by Yondu Udonta.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I'm sorry. I didn't know how this machine worked.
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
What a bunch of a-holes. Transport all four to the Kyln. 


THE KYLN
HIGH SECURITY PRISON
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.
But, hey, that's not my problem. I ain't gonna be here long. I've escape 22 prisons. This one's no
different. You're lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting
that bounty right now, and you'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a
talking raccoon.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hold. What's a raccoon.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
"What's a raccoon?" It's what you are, stupid.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Ain't no thing like me, except me.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is
it?
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So what? What's the Orb?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I have no words for an honorless thief.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. Yeah, I know who you are.
Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, we know who you are. Who is she?
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, you said that.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan. I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third
party.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot. 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, that's just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that. What is wrong with Giving Tree,
here?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to "I" and "am" and
"Groot". Exclusively in that order.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, a real fast.
(Peter saw a guard fiddling with his walkman)
Hey. Put that away. Hey! Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off. That's mine.
Those belong to impound. That tape and that player is mine!
(Peter electrocuted by the prison guard)
Hooked on a feeling, Blue Swede, 1973. That song belongs to me!

(In the prison)
 THE PRISONERS
- You first! You first!
- Murderer! Coming for you first, Gamora!
- You're dead!
- You're scum! You're scum!
(Gamora is thrown with a variety of objects by other prisoners)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
It's like I said, she's got a rep. a lot of prisoners here have lost their families to Ronan and his goons.
She'll last a day, tops.
 THE PRISONERS
- Murderer!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
The guards will protect her, right?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
They're here to stop us from getting out. They don't care what we do to each other inside.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Whatever nightmares the future holds, are dreams compared to what's behind me.
 THE PRISONERS
Check out the new meat. I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly, and go to town... (Groot poked
The Prisoner's nose and lifted him)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Let's make something clear. This one here is our booty! You wanna get to him, you go through us!
Or, more accurately, we go through you.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I'm with them.
 THE PRISONERS
I hate you.
 OTHER PRISONERS
- No cell's gonna protect you for long.
- You're dead!

- Dead!
(Gamora being captured by the other prisoners)
 THE PRISON'S GUARD
Take her down to the showers. It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.
(Peter wake up)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill, where you going? Quill. Quill!
 THE PRISONER
Gamora, consider this a death sentence for your crimes against the galaxy.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You dare? You know who I am, yes?
 THE PRISONER
You're Drax. The destroyer.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
And you know why they call me this.
 THE PRISONER
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette, and my daughter, Camaria. He slaughtered them where they stood.
And he laughed!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Her life is not yours to take. He killed my family. I shall kill one of his in return.
 THE PRISONER
Of course, Drax. Here, I...
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill! What are you doing?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos. I'm your only hope at stopping him.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Crap.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose, I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman to try and do that to me. Look, this is from a smoking-hot
Rajak girl. Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise. I got, right here, a
Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax. She caught me with this skinny little A'askavariian who worked
in Nova Records. I was trying to get information. You never see an A'askavariian?. They have
tentacles, and needles for teeth. If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then... you don't care. But
there's the point. She betrayed Ronan. He's coming back for her. And when he does that's when
you...
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Why would I put my finger on his throat?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What? No, it's a symbol. This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I would not slice his throat. I would cut his head clean off.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It's a general expression for you killing somebody. You've heard this. You've seen this, right? (finger
in the neck) you know what that is.
 THE PRISONER
Yeah.. Yeah.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Everyone knows.
 THE PRISONER
No. No. (when Drax look at him)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive. Don't do his work for him.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.
 THE PRISONER
That was my favorite knife.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Listen! I could care less whether you live or whether you die.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Then why stop the big guy?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Simple you know where to sell my Orb.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How are gonna sell it when we and it are still here?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
My friend Rocket, here, has escaped 22 prisons.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
We're getting out. And then we're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Four billion units.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Holy shit.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan. If you free us, I'll lead you to the
buyer directly and I'll split the profit between the three of us.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Four of us. A sleep for the danger, awake for the money, as per frickin' usual.

You have been betrayed, Ronan.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
We know only that she has been captured. Gamora may yet recover the Orb.
No! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb. Look, your partnership
with Thanos is at risk. Thanos requires your presence. Now!

SANCTUARY
DOMAIN OF THANOS
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
With all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess, and yet you summon me.
 THANOS'S SUBORDINATE
I would lower my voice, Accuser.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.
 THANOS'S SUBORDINATE
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.
 THANOS'S SUBORDINATE
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!
 THANOS'S SUBORDINATE
Lower your tone! I may be your... (Ronan kill him) 

 RONAN (Lee Pace)
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.
 THANOS
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy, is you. Your politics bore me. Your demeanor is that of a
pouty child. And, apparently, you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora. I shall honor our
agreement, Kree, if you bring mr the Orb. But return to me again empty-handed, and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair. This is one fight you won't win. Let's head to the Kyln.

(In the prison)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
If we're gonna get out of here, we're gonna need to get into that watchtower. And to do that, I'm
gonna need a few things. The guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs. I need one.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Leave it to me.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
His leg?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Yeah. God knows I don't need the rest of him. Look at him, he's useless.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
All right.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
And finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light. Do you see it?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
There's a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires. To get into that watchtower, I
definitely need it.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How are we supposed to do that?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well, supposably these bald-bodies find you attractive. So maybe you can work out some sort of
trade.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You must be joking.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, I really hear they find you attractive.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air, and it's in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.
It's impossible to get up there without being seen. 

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I got one plan, and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery, so figure it out! Can I get back to it?
Thanks. Now, this is important. Once the battery is removed, everything is gonna slam into
emergency mode. Once we have it, we gotta move quickly, so you definitely need to get that last. Or
we could just get it first and improvise.
(Groot already removed the battery)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I'll get the armband.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Leg.
Prisoner, drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell, or we will open fire.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
Fire!
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You idiot! (climb Groot's body) How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?
The animal is in control. Fire on my command!
(After defeat the prison guard, Drax take the guard's weapon, and then throw it to Rocket)
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Creepy little beast!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh, yeah.

You need what? (asking to Peter)

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I'll need this.
Good luck. It's internally wired.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I'll figure something out.

Drop the leg! Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Rocket!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Move to the watchtower! (to Groot) 

 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
(Destroy the weapon machine which want to shoot Peter) You! Man who has lain with an
A'askavariian!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It was one time, man.

 (They are arrive in the watchtower)
 THE GUARD OF WATCHTOWER
We need all available guards in full combat gear...
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Why is this one here?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss. I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs who will kill me if I don't.
Here you go. (giving the leg to Rocket)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh I was just kidding about that leg. I just need these two things.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, I thought it'd be funny. Was it funny? Wait, what did he look like hopping around?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hahaha (laughing)
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
How are we going to leave?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, he's got a plan. Right? Or is that another thing you made up?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I have a plan! I have a plan!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It's just a metaphor, dude.

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
His people are completely literal. Metaphors are gonna go over his head.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Those are some big guns.
 THE PRISON'S GUARD
(Preparing the shoot target to the watchtower) On my command! Number one!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hold on! Number two!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I recognize this animal. We'd roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Not helping!
 THE PRISON'S GUARD
Number three!
All fire on my command! Three! Two! One!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I told you I had a plan.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That was a pretty good plan.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
The crumpled my pants up into a ball. That's rude! They folded yours.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
The Orb's there. Let's go.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wait, wait, wait.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What? 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That bastard didn't put it back.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Put what back?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Here. Get them to the ship. I will be right back.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How are you gonna possibly...
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go!

My neck!

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well. How's he gonna get to us?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He declined to share that information with me.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well, screw this, then! I ain't waiting around for some homie with a death wish. You got the Orb,
right?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
 Yes. (Checking the knapsack, but there is no Orb in there)

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No! we're not leaving without the Orb.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Behold.
This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan companion, what were
you retrieving?
You're an imbecile.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can't take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is
this?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Don't touch that! It's a bomb.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
A bomb? 

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Yup.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
And you leave it lying around?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I was gonna put it in a box.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What's a box gonna do?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
How about this one?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No! Hey! Leave it alone. Shut up.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hey!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What is that?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That's for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No one's blowing up moons.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So, listen I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We're heading in the right direction. For now.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
If we're gonna work together, you might try trusting me a little bit.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
And how much do you trust me?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I don't know what it is.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Put it down, you fool. You'll destroy us all.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Or just you, murderess. 

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I let you live once, princess!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I am not a princess!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I have no interest in money.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Great.
That means more money for the three of us.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
For the four of us. Partners.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I'll tell the buyer we're on
our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
She has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You got issues, Quill.

(In Kyln Prison)
I swear. I don't know where they went! I swear.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
If he knew where they were headed, he would have already told us.
Yeah.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant. Find the Orb. Any means, any price.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
And this place?
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
The Nova can't know what we're after. Cleanse it!
 

(In Broker's place)
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one? I like to stick „em all in a row on my control
console.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
I can't tell if you're joking or not.
 YONDU'S SURBORDINATE
He's being fully serious.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
In that case, I can show you...
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
But first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is, and why everybody cares so damn much about it. And
then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it.
 THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Sir, the high-end community is a... The high-end community is a... It's a tight-knit... Tight-knit... The
high-end community is a very tight-knit... I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers!
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

 THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Carina
 CARINA
Yes, master.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Your people do have elbows, do they not?
 CARINA
We do, master.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Then use them. I don't have to remain you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.
Do I? Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon.

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Heads up! We're inbound.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
What is it?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
It's called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent.
There are no regulations whatsoever here. 

KNOWHERE
MINING COLONY
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull.
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy.
It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
It sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, you should.
 CHILDRENS IN KNOWHERE
Excuse me
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Watch your wallets.
 CHILDRENS IN KNOWHERE
Can you spare any units?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Get out of here.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Your buyer's in there?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We are to wait here for his representative.
 BIG GUARD IN THE KNOWHERE
Get out of here!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
This is no respectable establishment. What do you expect us to do while we wait?

 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Yes! Yes! (playing)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Yahoo!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
My Orloni has won, as I won at all things! Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this
job. 

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
My connection is making us wait.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, "stab, stab. Those
are my terms."
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
My father didn't stress diplomacy.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thanos?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He's not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He
tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for
Ronan, I couldn't stand by and... Why would you risk your life for this? (menunjuk kea rah tape milik
Peter)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
My mother gave it to me. My mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up.
I happened to have it on me, when I was... The day that she... You know, when I left Earth.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What do you do with it?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Really? On my planet, there's a legend about people like you. It's called footloose. And in it, a great
hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing,
well... it's the greatest thing there is.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Who put the sticks up their butts?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What? No, that's just a...
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
That is cruel.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It's just a phrase people use.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
The melody is pleasant! No! (Peter want to kiss Gamora and Gamora become angry then put a knife
in Peter's neck)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What the hell?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not same starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your... Your
pelvic sorcery! 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
This is not what is happening here.
No.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Stop it!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What are you doing?
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That is true!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
He has no respect!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That is also true!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hold on! Hold on!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, you're drunk. All right? No one's laughing at you.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does! Well. I didn't ask to get made! I didn't ask to be torn
apart, and put back together, over and over, and turned into some.. Some little monster!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
He called me "vermin"! She called me "rodent"! Let's see if you can laugh after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night
and you're rich.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Fine. But I can't promise, when all this is over I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're
already trying to kill them!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant. And Ronan is no closer to being dead.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Drax!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Let him go. We don't need him.


 CATARINA
Milady Gamora. I'm here to fetch you for my master.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.
 CATARINA
We house the galaxy's largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manners. I present to you.
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
What is that this there?
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Sir... (to Groot)
You must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of
course.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
That's your pet?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
His what?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Tivan. We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Very well, then. Let us see what you brought.

 RADIO MAN
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me...
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You shall send a message for me.
 

 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. Then the universe exploded
into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity
Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe.
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Once, for a moment... a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.
(The Ord is opened) Beautiful. Beyond compare.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Blah blah blah. We're all very fascinated, whitey. But we'd like to get paid.
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
How would you like to get paid?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What do you think fancy man? Units!
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Very well, then.
(Carina approach the kernel of the Orb) Carina. Stand back.
 CARINA
I will no longer be your slave!
 TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
No!
(Carina hold the kernel of the Orb and Tivan's place be burst)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What the f...
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What do you still have it for?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I can't believe you had that in your purse!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There's a chance they can contain it.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Are you kidding me? We're wanted by the Nova Corps. Just give it to Ronan.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So he can destroy the galaxy? 

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What are you, some saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you
wanna save it?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands. We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Right, right, okay. I think you're right. Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us,
who's really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it's a really good balance between both of your
points of view.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You're despicable. Dishonorable. Faithless!
Oh no. (Gamora see if Ronan and his army are coming)
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
At last! I shall meet my foe and destroy him.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You called Ronan?
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Quill! Don't you move, boy! Don't you move! Get out of my way!
(Ronan come out from his ship)
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Ronan the Accuser!
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
You are the one who transmitted the message?
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You killed my wife. You killed my daughter!

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I told you, you can't fit. Now, wait here. I'll be back. (to Groot)

 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
No.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Nebula, retrieve the Orb. (while have a fight with Drax)

 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
The stone is in the furthest pod.
Bring it down! 


 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
How? We've got no weaponry on these things.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
These pods are industrial grade. They're nearly indestructible.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Not against necroblasts, they're not.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That's not what I'm saying.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Let me borrow your ride.

(Drax still fight with Ronan)
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
I don't recall killing your family. I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Quill, I'm trapped. I can't make it to the Milano. I have to head out.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hate you least.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Nebula, please... If Ronan gets this stone he'll kill us all.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Not all. You will already be dead. (Nebula shoot Gamora's pod until shattered)
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan, it is done. (Nebula cone to pick up Ronan)

(Peter look at Gamora)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there's nothing we
can do for her. These pods aren't meant to be out here. In second, we're gonna be in the same boat.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Damn it. (Peter preparing to get out from the pod) 

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
(Peter deliver a message to Yondu) Yondu! Yondu. This is Quill! My coordinates are 227 K324.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill! Quill, what are you doing?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Just outside Knowhere. If you're there, come get me. I'm all yours.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill, don't be ridiculous. Get back into your pod! You can't fit two people in there. You're gonna
die. You'll die in seconds! Quill.
(Peter save Gamora after get in touch with Yondu)

(In Yondu's ship)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Quill? What happened?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I saw you out there. I don't know what came over me. But I couldn't let you die. I found something
inside of myself. Something... incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but, objectively..
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Where's the Orb?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It's.. well, they got the Orb.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What?
 YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Welcome home, Peter.

(Groot save Drax then Rocket is coming)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots! Quill just got himself captured. None of this ever would have
happened if you didn't try to single-handedly take on a frickin' army!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You're right. I was a fool. All the anger, all the rage, was just to cover my loss.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh boohoo. "My wife and child are dead" I don't care if it's mean! Everybody's got dead people. It's
no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way!
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the
universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives before that whackjob ever gets there.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot. 

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Save them? How?
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I know there're the only friends that we ever had, but there's an army of Ravagers around them. And
there's only two of us!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Three.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You're making me beat... up grass! (while beat up grass)

(In the Ronan's ship)
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
The Orb is in my possession, as I promised.
THANOS
Bring it to me.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Yes, that was our agreement. Bring you the Orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now
that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.
THANOS
Boy, I would reconsider your current course.
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Not anymore. (memegang batu Orb) You call me "boy"! I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on
Xandar, and burn it to its core! Then, Thanos, I am coming for you.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?
RONAN (Lee Pace)
You dare to oppose me?
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
You see what he was turned me into. If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
You betray me? (Hit Peter) Steal my money?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Stop it! Leave him alone!
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted Terran before. I
saved your life! 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Oh will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face, like it's some
great thing, not eating me. Normal people don't even thing about eating someone else!
Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my
home and from my family.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
You don't give a damn about your Terra! You're scared because you're soft in here. Here, right here!
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Yondu. Listen to me. Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I know what he's got, girl.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Then you know we must get it back! He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.
We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy? Sentiment? Eating away your brain like maggots!
That's it.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No!
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Sorry. Boy. But a captain's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.
 YOUNDU'S SUBORDINATE
Captain's gotta teach stuff!
 ALL YOUNDU'S SUBORDINATE
Yes.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We got a ringer.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Is that right?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He's vulnerable.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, what do you say, Yondu? Me and you, talking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Hahaha... Let him go! You always did have a scrote, boy! That's why I kept you on as a young'un.
(someone shoot Yondu's ship) 

 YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. It's a weapon of my
own design.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
What the hell?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
If you don't hand over our companions now, he's gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new
one!
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I ain't buyin' it.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I'm giving you to the count of five. 5, 4, 3..
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No. wait, hold on! Rocket, it's me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We're fine!
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh hey, Quill. What's going on?

(In Yondu's ship)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You call that "figured it out"? we're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
They are ungrateful.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What's important now is we get the Ravangers' army to help us save Xandar.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We'll figure that part out later.

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We have to stop Ronan.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
How?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I have a plan.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You've got a plan?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yes.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
First of all, you're copying me from when I said I had a plan.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No, I'm not. People say that all the time. It's not that unique of a thing to say.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I have part of a plan!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
What percentage of a plan do you have?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You don't get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I just saved Quill.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We've already established that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
When did we establish it?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Like three seconds ago!
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of something else.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
She's right. You don't get an opinion. What percentage?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I don't know. Twelve percent.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Twelve percent? Hahaha
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That's a fake laugh.

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
It's real!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Totally fake.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
It's barely a concept.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You're taking their side?
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
So what, it's better than 11%? What the hell does that have to do with anything?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot's the only one of you has a clue. Guys. Come on. Yondu is
gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around
at us. You know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we
have. All of us. Our home, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more that it gives. But
not today. Today, it's given us something. It has given us a chance.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
To do what?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
To give a shit. For once. Not to run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan
wipes out billions of innocent lives.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it's impossible. You're asking us to die.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, I guess I am.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. I will be grateful to die among my
friends.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, I will see my wife and
daughter again.
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Huh.. what the hell. I don't got that long a life span, anyway. Now I'm standing. Y'all happy? We're
all standing up now. bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.
(song playing)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge. 

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova
Corps.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Everything will die.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So Ronan does not make the surface.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster's Starboard hull. Then, our craft and
Yondu's will enter.
 YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Once they know we're on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on
desk. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We'll make it to the flight desk, and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone. Use these devices to contain it. If you touch it, it will
kill you.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan. That guy's eye.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No! No, we don't. no, we don't need that guy's eye.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.

Ronan fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.

 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Remember, boy. At the end of all this, I get the stone. You cross me, we kill you all.

 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Let's go get „em, boys!

(small plane come out from Yondu's main plane)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
This is a terrible plan.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends.

(in Nova Corps)
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
Nova Prime. I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers. He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone and he's headed toward Xandar.
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Oh God.
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
It's a trick.
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
He's a criminal.
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Did he say why we should believe him?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
He said his crew just escaped from prison so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to
help. He says that he's an "a-hole". But he's not, and quoting him, here, "100% a dick".
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Do you believe him?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
Yeah.

(in the Ronan's ship)
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
A fleet approaches. They appear to be Ravagers.

 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Fire! Cover it down! Submerge!
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, hurry! 

 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
All pilots, dive! They're beneath us!

 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Evacuate the city. Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Forward thrust, now!

 YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Come on!

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill! Yondu! Now!
(Peter dan Yondu try to enter in Ronan's ship)
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Hell! I'm going down, Quill! No more games with me, boy! I'll see you at the end of this!
(Peter, Gamora, Drax, dan Groot still trying to enter Ronan's ship)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
There are too many of them, Rocket! We'll never make it up there!
(Suddenly Nova's army is coming and help them to against Ronan's army)
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
Peter Quill. This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you
here.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
They got my "dick" message!
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
Prove me wrong.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Yes! (Finally they success enter in Ronan's ship)
Yes! Haha (happy)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We're just Kevin Bacon.

 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
The starboard kern has been breached! We have been boarded!
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Continue our approach. 

 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
But the Nova Corps have engaged.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Seal security door! Now! Get out of my way!

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh man.
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade. The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.
Locked in!
We're locked in. (form a formations)

 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I can barely see.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
When did you learn to do that?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Pretty sure the answer is "I am Groot"
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I want you all to know that I am grateful to your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once
again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thanks.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
This dumb tree, he is my friend. And this green whore, she, too...
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You must stop!
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak. You stupid, traitorous...
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
 Nobody talks to my friends like that.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut down the power to the security doors.

(Yondu already in the mainland and pick up his cute little thing)

 RONAN'S SUBORDINATE
Yondu Udonta. Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps. Enough nonsense-Ravagers! Time to
die...

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Nebula, please. (Gamora and Nebula start to fight)

 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilot, enact immolation initiative.

 DENARIAN SAAL'S SUBORDINATE
They're dive-bombing the city! Denarian Saal, should we break formation?
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
No! hold your positions.

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Keep Ronan up there, Saal. We'll take care of the people down here.
 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

(In Ronan's ship)
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Star-Lord.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Finally.
(start a fight)
 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
You thief!

 KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
You will never make it to Ronan.

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.
 RAVANGER / YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Come on!
 

 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Finger to the throat means death. Metaphor. (to Korath)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, sorta.
Oh no.
(Ronan's men came again to fight them and Groot finished them all by lengthening his hand)

 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Xandar! You stand accused. You wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on
which you burn.

 DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
Rocket.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hold on, Saal, just... (Saal crushed and die because being wedged by Ronan's ship)
Quill, you gotta hurry. The city's been evacuated, but we're getting our asses kicked down here.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

(Gamora still fight with Nebula)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Nebula! Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know he's crazy.
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
I know you're both crazy.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No!
(Nebula choose to cut her hand that stuck rather than be rescued by Gamora. She fell on a ship)
What the?
 NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Get out!

(Gamora opened the door and they went into the Ronan's room, and shot him)
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You did it!
(Ronan is still alive)
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
I was mistaken. I do remember you family. Their screams were pitiful. I...
(Rocket crashed into Ronan with his ship and Ronan's ship began to destroyed and to save his friends
Groot create a protective circle with his whole body) 

 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, Groot! You can't. You'll die. Why are you doing this? Why?
 GROOT (Vin Diesel)
We
are
Groot.
(Ronan boat crashed to the mainland and destroyed)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I called him an idiot (cried while holding the wood chips from Groot„s body)
(Ronan out from his ship that is destroyed, he is not dead yet)
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You killed Groot!
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
Behold! Your guardians of the galaxy. What fruit have they wrought? Only that my father and his
father shall finally know vengeance. People of Xandar, the time has come to rejoice and renounce
your paltry gods!. Your salvation it at hand.
(Peter began dancing and singing to stop the action of Ronan who want to destroy Xandar and to give
time, to Rocket who secretly making weapons to shoot Ronan)
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Listen to these words. Now bring it down hard!
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
(surprise) What are you doing?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Dance-off, bro. me and you.
Gamora. (invite Gamora to dance but Gamora shook her head)
Subtle. Take it back.
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
What are you doing?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.
(Drax and Rocket fired to the Orb then Peter captures the stone that have come out from Ronan's
weapon that crushed)
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No! Peter! Take my hand!
(Peter holding Gamora's hand and Drax holding Peter's shoulder and Rocket holding Drax's finger)
 RONAN (Lee Pace)
You're mortal! How?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You said it yourself, bitch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.
(Ronan died) 

 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Well, well, well. Quite the light show. Ain't this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before
all the nookie-nookie starts.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Peter, you can't. Peter.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don't know who you're selling this to, but the only way the
universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain't one. Hand it over, son.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yondu. Do not open that Orb. You know that, right? You've seen what it does to people.

(In Yondu's ship)
 YONDU'S SUBORDINATE
Yeah, Quill turned out okay. It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad like we was hired to
do.
 YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
He is gonna pissed when he realizes I switched out the Orb on him.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He was gonna kill you, Peter.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I know. But he was about the only family I had.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No. He wasn't.

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Why would you even know this?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I'm not Terran?
 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
You are half Terran. Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well, he's something very ancient we've
never seen here before.
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
That could be why you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did. 

 NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Your friend have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we'd like to express our profound gratitude
for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thank you, Nova Prime.

 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. It's really Thanos I need to kill.

 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wow I... Thank you.
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
I have a family. They're alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged.
However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
You will be arrested.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
It's still illegal.
 ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That doesn't follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? What are you laughing at? Why? I
can't have a discussion with this gentleman?
 DRAX (Dave Bautista)
What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine?
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
That's... That's actually murder. It's one of the worst crimes of all. So... also illegal.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
They'll be fine, Dey. I'm gonna keep an eye on „em.
 CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
You?
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah. Me.
 

(In the ship Peter opened a gift from his mother)

 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So, what should we do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?
 GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.
 PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Bit of both.
THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY WILL RETURN.
END.
